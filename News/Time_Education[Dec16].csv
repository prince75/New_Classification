The law stipulates that all schools must procure a ""recognition certificate"" from the government which would be renewable every three years.Institutions failing to obtain the certificate can be deemed derecognised and heavy fines could also be slapped on them under the provisions of the Act."

Foreign students slam Hindi institute for dirty hostels,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Foreign-students-slam-Hindi-institute-for-dirty-hostels/articleshow/53988587.cms,"NEW DELHI: HRD ministry has sought a detailed report from Kendriya Hindi Sansthan, Agra, on allegations by many foreign students that the institute has turned a blind eye to pathetic living conditions in the hostel.Exasperated with the callous attitude of the institute management, some foreign students raised the matter on social media by posting pictures of unhygienic hostel toilets and even a video of an ill student, Raynuka Baldeo, being rushed by her friends to hospital in a three-wheeler.No one from KHS was present even in the hospital. The ill student from Trinidad then contacted her country's mission in India for help to return to her country. On Friday KHS agreed to send Baldeo and late in the evening she was flown to Trinidad.One foreign student told TOI, ""Ever since Raynuka's case came to public domain, institute is trying to shift the blame on us for being demanding (sic). Top functionaries of KHS hardly interact with us and despite repeated reminders nothing has been done about pathetic conditions."" Nand Kishore Pandey, director, KHS told TOI that Baldeo's matter is being blown out of proportion. He said, ""she wanted to go back and raised the issue of mismanagement"" Pandey says there are 100 foreign students in KHS and there are separate hostels for male and female students. Indian students numbering 150 have their own hostels.This year 85 foreign students from 31 countries have already joined. Pandey admits that hostels are old and there is a move to get them renovated.According to Pandey, the root of the discontent among foreign students lies in the lack of non-vegetarian food in the hostel mess. He said both Indian and foreign students manage the hostel mess and KHS passes on the cost to them. ""But non-vegetarian food is not allowed for many years. Foreign students complain that it be allowed,"" he said.Pandey also points out that since KHS pays for the annual ticket home for foreign students, bookings are done in advance according to the yearly academic calendar."

Under RTE, every school has to admit 25% students from local areas at low fees. ""But this is a standalone academy recognised by the IB Organisation in Switzerland. The school gives a disclaimer that it is not recognised or affiliated to any board or university in India and hence cannot be subject to RTE,"" Sathe argued.

The students were earlier barred from admission to the next year on pretext that they scored below 5 cumulative performance index (CPI). Students claimed that they have been served termination letter stating they failed to register themselves for next session. However, students alleged they were never informed about any such rule. On the other hand, IISER authorities told TOI they have done everything according to the rule. Students have now filed a complaint to the MHRD against the institute. Terminated students alleged institute is playing with their career. ""We were served a year-drop notice by the authorities for scoring below 5 CPI in the first week of August. We came to know about this rule when we went for registration for the next class. August 10 was the last date for registration and we were not allowed. Today, they have served termination notice,"" said a student wishing anonymity. Students claimed they were never informed about termination in case they secure CPI below five. He said, ""In the mail, they have given the reason that we have been terminated for not registering for the next class. When we were not allowed to register for next class, how is it that we are being blamed for not registering. In the mail, IISER's dean academic, Saptarishi Mukherjee stated: ""In view of you not registering for 2016-17-I Semester by last date stipulated for late registration i.e. August 10, 2016, we regret to inform you that you have been marked for TERMINATION* from your academic programme."" Students have been asked to appeal to ""Chairperson, senate, IISER Bhopal"", against the termination with the explanation of failure to register by the deadline. Last date for appeal is August 30 for this. Another student pleading anonymity said: ""Deadline for registration was August 10 and they took 16 days to tell us about termination. They have cited our non-registration as reason for termination. The fact remains, institute never allowed us to register in the first place. So how could have we go ourselves registered,"" he said. He added: ""On August 1, we were given notice for year-drop and today they are talking about our termination. Suddenly, year-drop turned into termination without prior information."" In frustration, 'harassed' students have started leaving the campus. ""This is a research institute. No one can keep on fighting with the authorities who are not ready to understand the impacts of wasting one year. In this situation, students who could afford are leaving. A girl recently left the institute after authorities refused to help,"" said another student. Students who have scored above 5 CGPA have also come in support of the victim students. ""Let them give an opportunity. Termination is little harsh for them,"" said a senior student without quoting his name.

It would also be proposed that ""BTech passouts from IITs who have job experience and are interested in research should be enrolled in PhD,"" they added. A ministry official said the larger idea is to solve the problem of faculty crunch in IITs. He said it is ironical that despite around 2,000 PhDs coming out of IITs each year, the same number of vacancies exist. ""When it comes to hiring teachers, IITs are very selective. The need is to improve the quality of PhD and attract bright IIT students to undertake research,"" a source said.

""It will not be big enough to compensate the salary a IIT student gets after BTech but it will probably be among the highest,"" one official said.

It had suggested a minimum of 0.6 PhDs per faculty annually, eventually reaching 1 PhD per faculty. On this basis, the committee had suggested that the IIT system should be scaled to 16,000 faculty and 1,60,000 total student strength (with 40,000 at the PhD level, 40,000 at the Masters level and 80,000 UG students) by around the year 2020."

In premier colleges, a student joining MBBS this year will end up paying at least Rs28 lakh for the four-and-a-half-year course, excluding illegal capitation fee. According to the notification, the fee will be effective for next three years for the students who will get admission in the 2016 session. The fees may be revised in 2019 again. If a rough assumption is to be made, one will find a jump of around 100% in the last six seven years After considering proposal of private colleges AFRC has announced the revised fees structure for MBBS course students. But, few colleges that turned in private universities are yet to declare the fees they will charge this year. As private universities are regulated by Madhya Pradesh Private University Regulation Commission, the fee hike proposal of few medical colleges that turned into universities this year is yet to come out. Across the country, private universities have started increasing the tuition fee for MBBS courses this academic year in anticipation that all states will be mandated to take up the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).Sources said that the Supreme Court's order has made it mandatory for medical colleges to admit students solely on merit. The uneven fee hike has also resulted into anguish as students and students' union leaders on Monday went on to protest against the unfriendly move of AFRC."

Nearly 10L teachers’ posts lying vacant across country: Union MoS HRD,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Nearly-10L-teachers-posts-lying-vacant-across-country-Union-MoS-HRD/articleshow/53789123.cms,"BAREILLY: Union minister of state for human resource development (HRD) Mahendra Nath Pandey said on Saturday that there are nearly 8-10 lakh posts of teachers lying vacant in schools and higher educational institutions across the country. He said that the government is taking initiative to clear the backlog and is also inviting suggestions to update the education policy which has not been revised since 1976.  Pandey, who was in Bareilly to participate in an event organized by Akhil Bharatiya Brahmin Mahasabha, told TOI, ""Though it is true that there is an acute shortage of teachers in the country, it has been created due to a long backlog of posts lying vacant over years and we are working to appoint more faculty members soon. We have identified that there is requirement of nearly 10 lakh teachers across the country in both schools and higher educational institutions."" Hinting at a revamp of the education policy, Pandey said, ""In our country, the education policy is not properly implemented as it was first made in 1962 and then it was revised in 1976. However, no successive government took the initiative to revise it in all these years. We are now inviting suggestions to introduce changes according to the current challenges and prepare a new education policy."" Asked about universities not being able to maintain quality due to rising number of affiliated colleges which at times run into hundreds, Pandey said, ""Fixing total number of affiliated colleges per university is in the agenda of both central and state governments. We are thinking about it."" The minister said that maintaining quality of higher education was his priority. ""Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme has been introduced to improve the standard of higher education in the country.

BACKGROUNDXPSUs back at IITs with job offers for studentsMUMBAI: Public sector undertakings (PSUs), which had stayed away from the first phase of campus placements at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in December last year, are keen to recruit students during the second round, which has kicked off.  The Madras high court had restrained PSUs from hiring through campus placements after a PIL sought cancellation of the practice, saying it was opposed to the public employment policy. With the court vacating its stay, the PSUs are looking at hiring IITians once again. The court's final order on the PIL is still pending.  While IIT-Bombay is in talks with two PSUs for the second phase of hiring, IIT-Madras, where one PSU has already hired, is likely to be approached by two more undertakings in the coming days.  Though the court's interim order came late last year, several PSUs had planned their hiring on the basis of the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) scores.  Many PSUs, which are hiring on the basis of students' Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering scores, had released job advertisements much before they received a copy of the court's order. ""The PSUs had to go by the process they had planned and  could not have changed their hiring plan overnight after the order. Now, many have shown a keen interest in hiring from the IITs. So they will be coming on the campus in the second phase  ,"" said the deputy registrar of placements at IIT-Madras, B Nagarajan.  IIT-Bombay is in talks with a couple of PSUs too for their second phase of placements.  The Defence Research and Development Organization will visit the IITs in the first week of February.  IIT-B's professor in-charge of placements Avijit Chatterjee said, ""The stay has been vacated for now. So, we are in talks with PSUs. who have shown AN interest in our students.  Students, who were placed in the first phase, will not be allowed to sit in the second round. But those who did not get a job in their preferred choices will be allowed to appear for the interviews.""  The second phase, which started at IIT-B on January 7, is going slow. The interviews are scheduled only on the weekends.  Of the total 1,400 students, nearly 900 got jobs in the first phase. , which ended in December.  At IIT-Madras, over 500 students will sit for job interviews in the are yet of the 1,250 registered ones, are to be placed in the second phase which started on January 16.

An IITian said, ""The wait was pretty long, but we are happy that we got through.  The company has informed us about the pending court order. Having spent so much on our training, it is not keen on losing us.""  An official said, ""We do not know what will be the final order. Also, if the order is not in the favour of PSUs, students may suffer. Initially, the PSUs were also hesitant to visit our campuses due to the pending court order.

New clause inserted in draft statute of Jadavpur University,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/New-clause-inserted-in-draft-statute-of-Jadavpur-University/articleshow/53623675.cms,"KOLKATA: Raj Bhavan in consultation with the state government has included a fresh clause dealing with ""service and discipline"" inserted in the draft statute which was sent to the chancellor's office by Jadavpur University. This has once again raised ruffles among stakeholders — teachers, officers and non-teaching staff —who see it as yet another instance of vendetta politics.It is likely that the same clause will be introduced in the statute of other state run universities soon.The clause states that any employee found guilty of ""unethical propagation"" of views against the interest of the university and policies of the state government are liable for punishment that may also take his job. JU teachers see this as a ""draconian step"" to stifle non-conformist views in the mass media, a step that is likely to be replicated in other state universities as well. The state government had earlier tried a similar restriction on state government college teachers that didn't work out as planned. ""The university has received the draft statute from the chancellor's office a week ago, copies of which have been distributed among the stakeholders for their opinions and observations. The draft statute that will govern the university once it is final has a clause on service and discipline of employees that was not sent by the university. According to procedure, copy of the draft from Raj Bhavan will be tabled at the university's highest policy making body — The Executive Council, along with the opinions of the stakeholders. The university will then send its views to Raj Bhavan,"" a JU officer said. The Jadavpur University Teachers' Association has called a general body meeting on August 12 to discuss the draft statute. ""We have called a JUTA general body to discuss and debate on the draft statute. We may seek legal opinion if necessary."" A Juta office-bearer said. What happens if the executive council differs with the clause? Those running university administration maintain that the university is well within its limits to send its views. But the final statute will be drawn up by the state government in consultation with the Raj Bhavan. The final draft will then go for vetting to the law department. The primacy of the state government in finalising the statute is because the government has happens to be the funding agency. However, this does not apply to the academic freedom, universities enjoy. Next comes the need for student discipline. The draft statute also makes a mention of a code of conduct for all the stake holders including students, the first step of which is to introduce biometric attendance for teachers and staff. The Mamata Banerjee government may table a Bill in the Assembly session touching upon the broad contours of the code of conduct applicable to all state universities. The Bill once adopted will require all the state universities to incorporate the clauses in their revised statute. A section, however, believes that the call for discipline with the punitive clause doesn't come without reason. ""Chancellors have time and again appealed to JU stakeholders, particularly students to refrain from gherao and recurrent agitation that cast its shadow on the convocation programme also. The present chancellor sent a word of caution to students during the fracas over screening a film inside JU campus. He urged students to go back to their classrooms because such behaviour didn't go well with the university's image. JU stakeholders didn't pay heed to the suggestion. Instead, a section of teachers fuelled anti-establishment sentiments,"" a JU employee said."

Thousands apply for handful of seats left in Delhi University colleges,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Thousands-apply-for-handful-of-seats-left-in-Delhi-University-colleges/articleshow/53426170.cms,"NEW DELHI: It's a deluge Delhi University (DU) colleges were clearly not prepared for. They had invited applications for a handful of seats left unfilled after the fifth cutoff list admissions. What they got in response were a mindboggling tens of thousands of applications for seats ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred. Hans Raj College, for instance, is saddled with 84,000 applications for the 50 seats it needs to fill up. That's 1,680 candidates per seat. Similarly, Ramjas has 57,000 applicants for 100 seats and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya 37,000 applications for 25-odd seats. Lady Shri Ram College has to contend with 1,800 aspirants for six seats in the psychology programme.While colleges were supposed to issue the merit list by 5pm on Wednesday, a majority of them were at their wit's end on how to work out a merit list from such big database at such short notice. Some blamed the University for not processing the data properly. According to an official from the dean of stu dents' welfare, 17-odd colleges received over 40,000 applications while another nine got over 20,000 applications.Such is the demand all colleges are overwhelmed with applications. Hindu college, for instance, has received over 5,000 applications for six seats in BCom (H). ""We are working on the data. The numbers are huge. And we have to work out a merit list only based on the number of seats available,"" said Anju Srivastava, principal, Hindu College.Another north campus college with over 40,000 applications is Kirori Mal College. It has close to 300 seats under all categories still unfilled.""LSR received 1,811 applications for the six general category seats in psychology. We never imagined such big numbers. That makes our work even tougher to prepare a merit list. We will go step wise, as directed by the university. In case of the best-of-four scores being the same, we will have to consider the overall class XII aggregate,"" said Kanika Ahuja, media coordinator, LSR.What's troubling many colleges is that many applicants have already secured a seat in a DU college. As soon as the unfilled seats status was announced, these students applied to other colleges and courses without withdrawing from the course they are enrolled in. ""The problem is that if these students are offered seats, their current seats will fall vacant and it will only prolong the admission process,"" said a principal of a south Delhi college.""Initially candidates were not allowed to apply without cancelling their admission in other colleges, "" the principal said. ""Some of them came to us seeking an assurance that they would get the seat in case they cancel. That's something we can't promise. Only students from St Stephen's and Jesus and Mary, as they are not part of DU's centralised admission process, were allowed to apply without cancelling their admissions. Later, the DSW office rightly allowed other students the same facility,"" he added."

The government colleges are giving advertisements in newspapers claiming that their courses have been approved by the state government. This is not the norm for opening a new branch. It needs AICTE approval.""Dash said the government's move of expansion defies logic because several seats are lying vacant in private colleges. Of the around 46,000 seats, more than 50% went without first year admissions in the past four years.However, government officials defended the expansion move. E Saibaba Reddy, vice-chancellor of Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology (VSSUT), Burla, said: ""Universities have the autonomy to open new courses without AICTE approval. The AICTE approval is binding on private colleges.""Despite the AICTE approval not being mandatory, the VSSUT is still in the process of obtaining it for all the new courses because that will ensure the MTech students become eligible for scholarships/stipends from the ministry of human resource development, Reddy said.Tushar Nath, chairman of Odisha joint entrance examination (OJEE) committee, said the government has to expand the technical institutions to ensure that the poorer sections of society also receive good education at an affordable price. ""Vacancies in private institutions can't be a criteria to not to expand government colleges as their fee is comparatively less,"" he said.Technical education secretary L N Gupta recently wrote to the VCs of VSSUT and Biju Patnaik University of Technology to make college-wise plans to ensure the AICTE approval for all the courses.In 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General had pointed out that the state-run-technical institutions offered courses, which were not approved by the AICTE. ""The AICTE did not approve these courses owing to lack of infrastructure, violation of norms for creation of additional courses and increase in intake of existing courses,"" the CAG report on economic sector for the year ending March 2015, read. The accreditation of the courses by the National Board of Accreditation is necessary for getting AICTE approval."
DU open school gets image boost as 4 students with 100% marks join courses,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/DU-open-school-gets-image-boost-as-4-students-with-100-marks-join-courses/articleshow/53330456.cms,"NEW DELHI: A score of 100% in best-of-four subjects would open the doors of admission into any Delhi University college. Yet, four students with this perfect score have enrolled themselves in DU's School of Open Learning, opting for a degree through distance learning. They are not the only highgraders taking admission in SOL this year. The list includes 13 students with scores above 95% and 240 with marks above 90%. In fact, students with a score of 80% and above constitute more than 10% of all admission-takers.As these numbers clearly show, the image of SOL as the refuge of 'non-serious' students who can't get admission anywhere else — or those pursuing a degree while working — is fast changing. Although the figures are also a reflection of the extremely high cut-offs in DU colleges, many career oriented students are taking to distance learning for several advantages it gives them. For instance, SOL admitted three 100-percenters into its BCom course although they did not have Maths at the plus-2 level. These students opted for BCom at SOL because it would give them more time to prepare for the CA exam. ""Among high scorers, majority of them have chosen BCom (H), followed by BA. Rest have taken English and political science honours courses. The reason why they are here is because of the DU degree and also majority of them will try to pursue chartered accountancy,"" said C S Dubey, Campus of Open Learning head.As per admission data till 5 pm of July 21, 2016, over 49,000 candidates have registered online for SOL courses of which nearly 13,000 have completed the admission process. Over 900 of these students have an aggregate between 80% and 89% in their class XII Boards, while another 240 have 90% and above as aggregate. ""DU is a big draw for its reputation. As I could not manage a seat in a college of choice in BCom (H) with 90.25% marks in best-of-four, I decided to join SOL. This also offers me time to prepare for chartered accountancy,"" said Puneet Jain. Many top scorers taking admission in SOL plan to prepare for other competitive exams. ""We have many students who could have got admission in some DU colleges. But they also want to prepare for civil services and since they didn't get a seat in a college of their choice, they came to SOL,"" added Dubey. Officials said SOL was an attractive option for many candidates from relatively poor families for whom a regular college was unaffordable. High cutoffs in colleges too have nudged people towards SOL. In courses such as English, the fifth cutoff remains above 94% in 12 colleges and above 90% in 20. In BCom (H), out of the 30 colleges, 29 have cutoffs of over 90%."

With the addition of four new IITs this year, total seats would rise to 10,500 from the previous year's 10,006. The ministry of human resources and development (MHRD) has already released a notification asking the IITs to include the four new institutions in Jammu, Goa, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh in this year's admission process. Considering that 1.6 lakh students registered for JEE (Advanced) on May 22, around 14 students will be vying for each seat in the premier institutes this year. The IITs in Dharwad, Karnataka, and Goa will be mentored by IIT-Bombay. The premier Powai institute will run the two institutes at least in the first year and simultaneously recruit faculty as part of the mentoring. IIT-B director Devang Khakhar said both institutes are gearing up to commence sessions from this academic year of 2016-17. Each of these two IITs will have a total of 120 seats, with 40 each in computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering branches. In the first year, professors from IIT-B will take classes, added Khakhar. Similarly, IIT-Jammu will be mentored by IIT-Delhi and IIT-Chhattisgarh will be under the wings of IIT-Hyderabad. ""Of the four new institutes, three were to start in 2015. Due to permissions from the respective state governments, requirement of land and so on, they postponed the commencement by a year. These three institutes should not have any problem in admitting students this year. Only IIT-Dharwad is completely new,"" said a JEE (Advanced) official. The official added that the ministry of human resources and development has already given them a notification to go ahead with the admission process in these four new institutes. ""However, three institutes backed out from the process last year too. But these institutes got almost a year to set up infrastructure. There are minor chances of institutes backing out this year. There could be variations in the intake capacity of existing IITs, too. The final list will be compiled by the month-end,"" added the official. Although they are new, IIT-Tirupati and IIT-Palakkad, which commenced sessions last year, managed to fill most of the seats.  In fact, more than 80% of the seats at Tirupati and Palakkad were filled in the first round itself during last year's admissions.

He said, those whose family income is below Rs 9 lakh per annum also get zero per cent education loan.""Education must be inclusive. But those capable of paying must pay. You should not oppose when rich are being asked to pay,"" the minister said.Javadekar said in order to address the issue of high fees of IIT coaching class entrance exam, the government has started online programme IIT-PAL.Under this programme the students can take free tutorials, exams, homework.In future, he said, the government is also planning to take it at the television level for a wider access.To a question about the role of industry in the IITs, Javadekar said the government is even ready to reduce its control but the industry has to accept a larger responsibility.He said the government has been working to provide Wi-Fi connectivity of 1 GBPS network to all universities in the country which will slowly be extended to the colleges affiliated to it as well in next two years.In Central universities, this facility will be extended to classrooms, canteens, hostels, the minister said.Javadekar also sought to dispel the notion that the funding in IITs have gone down, saying this year, the government has allocated Rs 4035 crore to the IITs as against Rs 3855 crore the last year.

There will be in-service training and pre-service training. All vacant slots will be fulfilled,"" he said.Javadekar said the government is trying to ensure safe guard of teaching community's ""dignity"" withA""compassion"" and also added that the teachers will be given ""freedom"". And along with these there will be emphasis on accountability.Stressing on the role of research, he said several schemes are being evolved to promote research especially among technological institutes.A separate funding of Rs 1,000 crore will be made for this, he said adding under this, ""customized research"" of industries will be encouraged wherein academicians from NITs and IITs and other such technological institutes will be involved.""We will encourage more incubation centres and under which even after graduation NIT and IIT pass outs and graduates can also be allowed to visit their institutes and take part in research,"" Javadekar said.The bill, later passed by voice vote, seeks to establish the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Andhra Pradesh as an institute of national importance under the National Institutes of Technology, Science Education and Research (NITSER) Act, 2007.Among others Congress member Shashi Tharoor, (Congress), Kambhampati Haribabu (BJP) and RSP member N.K.

IIT-Delhi has 523 teachers (including emeritus professors and others) against 776 posts; they'll need an estimated Rs 1,000 crore to finance the expansion of infrastructure, for good housing, libraries and laboratories; they'll need support for research. Saying, ""Don't look toward us,"" Javadekar encouraged them to create a ""road-map"" that'll let IITs ""stand on their own by 2030.""In separate sessions, Javadekar interacted with faculty members and students - many of them PhD students still on campus during vacations. They, too, raised the issue of funds, with one -- Munish Joseph from the Department of Management Studies -- saying outright that the government ""should improve quality of the IITs instead of increasing their number."" ""If you can't fund, don't start new IITs. Don't raise funds from students,"" he said. He also pointed out that the fee-hike may be offset by loans for the college years but youngsters are now graduating ""with huge debt burden."" ""There are no jobs befitting our degrees. Private universities pay paltry sums,"" complained PhD student Asmita Sharma. ""I am reviewing the situation in the IITs... About 40% positions are vacant so your batch and the next need not worry,"" replied Javadekar. However, another student demanded that government institutions be allowed to recruit directly from IITs.Students and teachers spoke of the coaching industry. Javadekar said he believes IIT-PAL, the online tutoring scheme for school kids, will weaken the coaching industry's grip on the engineering aspirant within a few years. IIT-Delhi will start recording for the programme soon. ""We've met Kendriya Vidyalaya teachers. They're not confident about teaching the JEE curriculum but want to partner with us,"" says IIT-D director, V Ramgopal Rao. There was a demand for expansion of counselling facilities as well.Rao points out that the government's quality improvement programme for engineering is too small in scale to be effective and MHA regulations deter appointment of foreign faculty. Deputy director, M Balakrishnan ""requested"" that ""files on visitor nominees"" be cleared. In turn, Javadekar wanted to know what the IITs can do ""to create the passion to be good teachers""; to ""stand on their own by 2030"" and ""develop business-academic partnerships""; and create news ideas ""for the way we teach.""Opinion is divided on awarding credits for massively open online courses (MOOCs). One teacher believes ""we're moving too fast."" ""We need to think about how exams will be conducted."" Another pointed out that MOOCs are no solution for the problem of access. ""Those taking online courses can't walk down the corridor with me, don't get to work with machines. Learning is not through the lecture-room only,"" he said.Several teachers resisted the idea of a self-financed IIT system. Speaking in general about the education system, Javadekar said that ""there's no accountability but there's protection."" IIT-Delhi is trying to raise funds from its alumni -- according to Javadekar, they collectively handle one trillion dollars worth of investment -- and corporations but Balakrishnan said that ""research programmes have to be funded by society."" ""Everywhere in the university system - even abroad - research is sustained by society. If research depends on industry alone, somebody else will define the programme,"" he says. Adding to the ""public-private debate"", Ravinder Kaur from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, argues that it is important ""to maintain the public nature of these institutions for their autonomy and independence."" Javadekar's committed Rs 1,000 crore to IMPRINT, a research initiative just for the IITs and Indian Institute of Science; Rs 280 crore to Uchchatar Avishkar Yojana and Rs 800 crore for startups and incubation centres. He said he's a ""product of the students movement"" and will return to IIT often.

Actually we all should try to improve them further and make them really world class institutes. Therefore quality is absolutely important,"" he said.Replying to Jairam Ramesh of Congress, who raised the issue of ensuring complete autonomy for the IITs, Javedekar said the HRD Ministry is not there on any board of IITs.""MHRD is not even represented on Board of Governors. It is completely run by the Board. We only facilitate in finance and that is where we will concentrate,"" he said.On funding for the premier institutes, he said there would not be any financial constraints for growth of IITs.The government is already working on a scheme for financing higher education infrastructure needs, particularly research infrastructure requirements, he added."

The University Grants Commission has written to all universities and colleges to include a subject on urban planning from the current academic year- 2016-17. The UGC directive comes after the implementation of smart city project by the Centre. Members of the UGC made a presentation to Prime Minister Modi on how towns and cities are emerging as key drivers of economic growth, and emphasized on the need for capacity building in urban administration and urban planning.UGC chairman, Jaspal Sandhu, said, ""It was proposed that colleges and universities should start subject/courses on urban planning. Accordingly, you (vice-chancellors of universities) are requested to start a subject/course on urban planning in your university and also convey relevant instructions to the colleges/institutes affiliated to your university to take urgent steps for starting of this new subject course at graduate and post graduate level.""The fact that most municipal bodies in India do not have urban planners is a cause for concern. ""Municipal bodies lack urban planning skills. They have engineers who may understand construction but aren't trained as planners. Municipal bodies should develop a cadre of urban planners and managers. There should also be an ongoing skill upgradation programme for municipal staff,"" said the South Asia Regional Director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), Shreya Gadepalli.

We also need urban planners who can come up with area-wise development plans in each municipality,"" said Shankar. Professor of sociology at Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, N R Suresh Babu, feels that urban planning should be taught based on city-specific requirements. ""While the foundation concepts will remain the same, we should understand the diverse geography of our country. Also, there is huge disparity with respect to population, mode of transport, drainage facility and water resources,"" said Babu. ""Universities and colleges should teach the subject or course keeping in mind the requirement of the city or district,"" he added."

Is CBSE inflating class XII marks to compete with other boards?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Is-CBSE-inflating-class-XII-marks-to-compete-with-other-boards/articleshow/53037988.cms,"NEW DELHI: Is the Central Board of Secondary Education, the largest body for conducting school exams in India, inflating marks to safeguard its students from a ""disadvantage"" on the assumption that other boards are doing so too?The 'topper scam' in Bihar board and reports that up to 80% of students so far admitted in DU's Shri Ram College of Commerce are from Tamil Nadu board, point to an unhealthy competition among various school boards to be 'liberal' in marking answer sheets and grant extra marks in the name of 'standardisation'.Consider this: CBSE gave as many as 16 extra marks in the class XII maths exam this year in the all-India set of papers and 15 marks in the Delhi set during the process of standardisation. In nine subjects, marks were 'standardised' up by more than 10%. As a result of the standardisation, a student with 77 marks in mathematics may have ended up getting 93 marks on the result sheet. Similarly, a student of business studies who would have otherwise got 80 marks, may have finally got as much as 92 marks in the subject.Although CBSE doesn't bunch subjects according to streams, a candidate with physics, chemistry, mathematics and English core from Delhi region may have ended up with a cumulative of 42 'extra' marks, a spike of over 10 percentage points in best of four aggregate.  Similarly, a student from the all-India pool with accountancy , business studies, economics, mathematics and English core combination could have a cumulative 49 'moderated' marks, again a nearly 10 percentage point gain overall.While moderation of marks has always existed to even out different levels of difficulty and other factors in an exam of such huge scale, sources said the exercise was conducted judiciously in the past. ""It would never lead to an increase of more than five marks,"" said a former CBSE chairman.One of the reasons cited by CBSE sources for such huge jumps in marks was that students of other boards were being given both 'moderation' and 'grace' liberally, which according to former CBSE chiefs ""is against the spirit of moderation"".Officially, CBSE denied that its standardisation process was in part a response to the liberal marking by other boards.However, the minutes of the board's result committee meeting belies this claim. It says, ""...members were of the opinion that the statistics shown will lead to CBSE's students in disadvantageous position in higher education in comparison to the students of other boards (like ICSE, UP board etc) who had given both moderation and grace liberally to their students."" TOI has a copy of the minutes. Admitting to a growing competition among boards, former CBSE chairman Ashok Kumar Ganguly has called up the HRD ministry and the Council of Boards of School Education in India to intervene.  ""There is a very unhealthy competition going on between the state and national boards. This should be nipped in the bud. We have seen what is happening in one of the colleges, where 75% to 80% of students are from a single board. This calls for a rationalization of marks before things worsen,"" Ganguly said.Also there seems to be inconsistencies in difficulty level between the question papers of the all-India and Delhi regions. Replying to TOI's queries, CBSE contradicted itself.To one query it said the exercise aimed to ""level up the mean achievements in the set-wise performance of the candidates attributable to the difference in the difficulty level of different set of question papers in the multiple sets scheme."" To another question, it replied, ""There is no inconsistency in question paper design and difficulty level of the question papers administered under the All India Scheme, vis-a-vis the question papers administered anywhere.""So, what explains the 11 moderated marks for the all India question paper in biology as against zero for Delhi region, or 12 marks for Delhi students in English (core) to zero for others, if the difficulty levels were the same?""Moderation should never exceed 5%. Its specific purpose is in case of difference in difficulty level within different sets of question papers and not because other boards are giving high marks.

The share of domicile students from the desert state was 12.49% out of 36,566 declared qualified for counselling for IITs. The first position is bagged by Uttar Pradesh with its share of 14.82%.The icing on the cake is that most of the successful students are from Hindi medium and rural backgrounds. Other states like Maharashtra (8.85%) and Bihar (7.42%), which have always made a mark in the IITs, are way behind Rajasthan, says office of JEE-Advanced exam. The share of Rajasthan students includes students from all boards including RBSE, CBSE, ICSE and IB.State's lion share is due to the emergence of quality CBSE schools in state, which experts feel has created a competitive ecosystem leading to mass selections from Rajasthan at national level exams like IITs, NEET and AIIMS. Explaining the reason behind this unprecedented success, Damodar Goyal of Society for Private Unaided School in Rajathan, said, ""Most of the schools have adopted an integrated system by preparing students for IITs. It has provided an ease for students to take up competitive exams in the highly educative environment,"" said Goyal.This year, CBSE schools in Jaipur have bagged three ranks in the top 10 of JEE-Advanced including top rank by Aman Bansal. From past three-four years, students from few selected cities in state like Jaipur and Kota, have been scoring top ranks not only in IITs but also in NEET and AIIMS exam. Data says 12 students from Rajasthan including seven from Jaipur and four from Kota made it in the top 100 list of JEE-Advanced.The state board-wise rating also put Rajasthan on the third spot. Leading the list was Telangana followed by Maharashtra on the second spot. However, CBSE is leading with 53.47% students.Data says that six students from RBSE board have made in the top 100 merit list of JEE-Advanced. Upbeat over the data, B L Choudhary , chairman of RBSE, said, ""The data reiterates our claim that RBSE is one of the toughest boards in the country . The fact that our toppers of Class XII science stream got selected in IITs further proves the transparency of our evaluation system.""Sources also told TOI that RBSE is all set to moot a proposal to introduce an aptitude test in the early classes to filter out students who have an interest or inclination towards science. ""The whole idea is to increase the number of students opting for science so that the output in terms of engineers and doctors can increase,"" said a board official."

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the online application portal to facilitate loans to students who wish to pursue higher studies in Delhi after graduating from Class XII. Conceived and developed by the Directorate of Higher Education, the Higher Education and Skill Development Guarantee Scheme will serve as an encouragement to students who are otherwise unable to pursue education due to lack of financial means. Under this scheme, students will not be required to furnish any collaterals or margin money and the scheme will be universal in nature regardless of the student's background. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said: ""Though the scheme was launched last year, we felt that it should be made online for the convenience of students and for better transparency. With this portal, students can apply online for loans which the participating banks will be obliged to provide. I believe this will transform education, enabling thousands of eligible students to pursue their studies and attain their career goals. We wish to encourage learning and are confident that such initiatives will break all the barriers and help students get higher learning of their choice.""  Kejriwal said that the launch of the portal was the fulfillment of a promise made by his government that no student in Delhi should be denied the opportunity for quality education due to lack of resources. ""We are improving the quality of education in the government schools, with better infrastructure, facilities and training for teachers. In three years' time, parents in Delhi will be proud to say that their children study in government schools.""

The numbers have fallen by almost a lakh this year compared to the 50,000 dip recorded last year.MUMBAI: The number of engineering aspirants registering for JEE (Main) has declined for the second year in a row. The numbers have fallen by almost a lakh this year compared to the 50,000 dip recorded last year. CBSE, which conducts the national-level joint entrance examination, received applications from 12.07 lakh aspirants last week. In 2015, 13.04 lakh students had registered for the test.  The fall was even steeper for Maharashtra, where the registrations have dropped by a third over last year. Maharashtra, however, has the highest number of applicants (1.63 lakh) in the country followed by Uttar Pradesh (1.50 lakh).  JEE (Main) is the qualifying exam for admissions to centrally-funded technical institutions such as NITs, IIITs and institutions in the participating states. Of the total numbers of students taking JEE (Main), the top 1.5 lakh are eligible to appear for JEE (Advanced) for admissions to the premier IITs. This year, the IIT Council has decided to shortlist 2 lakh candidates.    Students' interest in engineering waning: Experts  Experts attribute the fall to the waning interest in engineering and also to the variety of choices available to students in other professions in the last few years. Vijay Singh, former national coordinator for science Olympiads and a Raja Ramanna Fellow, said, ""For the last few years, the impression that an engineering degree does not guarantee you a job has percolated down %to students.  Engineering seats are going vacant dramatically in private colleges in several states. Unless they get admission in a good college, many are not keen."" He added that fancy courses such as hotel management, law, design, maritime, on the other hand, are picking up. ""Students who are keen on research in science are completing their undergraduate programme in science and are going abroad for higher studies to reputed foreign universities."" IIT-Bombay director Devang Khakhar agreed that students can pursue various interests.  ""There are several options available in humanities too,"" added Khakhar. IIT-Kanpur director Indranil Manna, however, said that a drop by few percentage points is hardly alarming. ""Many students who are serious about pursuing engineering and are motivated will definitely appear for the entrance test. But a few, who realize that engineering is not their cup of tea, will prefer to stay out,"" he said.  The drop in aspirants from Maharashtra has contributed largely to the overall drop in registrations. Maharashtra was a participating institute in JEE (Main) till higher and technical education minister, Vinod Tawde, decided to withdraw from the test this year. The state's decision to hold its own common entrance test (MHT-CET) for engineering admissions this year may be one of the important reasons for the drop. S K Mahajan, director, directorate of technical education, said, ""Students who do not have the capacity to appear for the national level competitive exam for IITs and NITs will prefer skipping it altogether.  The ones aiming to get into state institutes will favour the state's CET."" Another official pointed out that the constant changes in the Central test pattern would have discouraged a few aspirants from waiting for it. ""Also the JEE (Main) final scores are calculated by combining the test scores with class XII marks, which many students are not in favour of,"" said the official.

With his rank, he's a shoo-in for computer science at at least one of the IITs — that's also what mum and dad, pharmacist and chemist respectively, want — but his heart is set on aeronautical engineering at IIT Kanpur or Indian Institute of Space Sciences and Technology. His passion for it had even taken him to a workshop in NASA some years ago. ""I have been interested in aeronautical engineering all through. But if I don't get into ISRO, the options are few.

New education policy draft clashes with RTE,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/New-education-policy-draft-clashes-with-RTE/articleshow/52833194.cms,"NEW DELHI: Several recommendations in the draft National Education Policy, 2016 will require amendments to the Right to Education Act, 2009.Insisting on ""consolidation"", the draft proposes merging ""small, non-viable"" schools. This subverts the RTE Act on neighbourhood schools being located ""within a walking distance of one kilometre"" for children attending Classes 1 to 5.The draft emphasizes ""school mapping"" - as opposed to RTE's ""child-mapping"" - but stresses that for children attending ""non-viable"" schools, transport must be provided. It notes such ""consolidation"" is already on in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, all BJP-ruled states.The proposal to extend the 25 per cent economically weaker section quota in private schools to minority institutions will also need an amendment. The committee notes that number of schools claiming religious or linguistic minority status has increased tremendously.The RTE mandates a no-detention policy -banning grade-repetition -till Class VIII; the committee wants it limited to Class V. Its recommendations cover remedial classes ""by school teachers or volunteers"" and supplementary examinations.The committee suggests amending the RTE to ""provide, in addition to infrastructure, learning outcome norms that affect quality of education"", a longstanding private school demand.The report has much to say on infrastructure and the RTE. ""Infrastructure norms for recognition of private schools should be applied to government schools...and punitive action should be ensured for not adhering to them,"" it says.""States should be given flexibility to determine norms for infrastructure requirement,"" it adds. It proposes developing ""local norms...for 'alternate schools'"".

However, statistics show students with medical degrees from these countries are finding it increasingly difficult to pass the screening test that allows them to practice in India. The number of students taking the test has doubled but the pass percentage dropped from 50.12 in 2005 to 10.7 in 2015. In this period, the pass rate fluctuated around 20 per cent, dropping to an all-time low of 4.93 per cent in June 2014, when only 293 students passed. There has been an 80 per cent drop between 2005 and 2015, in Indian medical graduates from foreign universities passing the mandatory screening test that the National Board of Examinations holds. According to the Indian Medical Council Act, 2001, citizens with undergraduate degrees from outside India should clear the screening test conducted twice every year- June and December- before they do a one-year internship in one of the MCI recognised medical colleges. One has to score 50 per cent to clear the test. Students say the the test is extremely tough. ""Most questions are from postgraduate medical tests,"" said Raghuram Nayak, who completed his graduation in Ukraine in 2012. The students' association of foreign medical graduates say the board has made the test difficult to discourage students from going abroad and opt to study in private colleges here that charge as much as Rs 1 crore. These students aren't even considered graduates in India unless they pass the test. ""Many students spend lakhs in coaching centres to clear the test,"" said Raghuram. Officials at NBE deny these. An expert committee which studied 11 question papers from 2013 to 2015 submitted a report to the ministry of health stating that 52.78 per cent of the questions were of ""low difficulty"" and 42.22 per cent questions were of ""moderate difficulty"".

New UGC regulation will cull jobs by 50% in some college departments: DUTA,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/New-UGC-regulation-will-cull-jobs-by-50-in-some-college-departments-DUTA/articleshow/52733056.cms,"New Delhi: The Delhi University college teachers have now done the math and it has only proved what they already suspected. Teachers from over 15 departments from across colleges have discovered that if the amended UGC regulations on workload are implemented, they will face retrenchment to the tune of 30% to 50%. In this job-culling, ad hocs by the hundreds are sure to lose jobs and even permanent faculty are vulnerable. The DU Teachers' Association has been on evaluation boycott since May 24 and will not relent unless the UGC and Ministry of HRD completely ""roll-back"" the new regulations, redefining work-load of teachers. Nearly all teachers and student organisations from across the political spectrum — including ones generally considered close to the ruling BJP — are united on this issue. They point out that the very ad hocs responsible for the bulk of the evaluation in DU are facing retrenchment. Responding to a letter from the dean, examinations of DU, the president DUTA has written to the university vice-chancellor urging him to ""take the matter up with the MHRD for early resolution"". Nandita Narain has also sought the support of ordinary students through an open letter. Assuming all teachers in the department to be assistant teachers and the direct teaching hours to be 16 — as promised by UGC press releases — the number of teaching posts will reduce to 13.4 from 20 at the physics department of Miranda House. The Hindi department of the same college will lose 40.9% of it teaching posts. Similarly, economics at Shri Ram College of Commerce will lose 49.4%; Hindi department at Deshbandhu College will lose 49.8%; political science department at Ramjas will lose 44.1% and English at Kirori Mal, 39.5%, of its teaching posts. As per the 2010 UGC regulation, assistant teachers had to complete 16 ""direct teaching hours"" in a week including tutorials. The May 2016 amendment increased the DTHs to 18 and counted tutorials as separate and two hours of practical classes as one. ""In the case of science department, we find that as weightage of practicals has been halved (two hours count as one), the reduction in the number of teaching posts is at least 30%. In the case of humanities and social sciences, the retrenchment is in the range [of] 35%--50%. It is 50% in colleges where the ratio of lectures to tutorials is close to 1:1, as should be the case,"" writes DU executive council member, Abha Dev Habib in her note for the UGC."

Officials said it has been noted that around 15% of students opt out when they fail to get the branch of their choice. This time the number of such students is expected to be 7000-odd: that leads to the estimation of overall vacancy of 30,000.The low enrolment of students will lead to a fall in the merit score cut-off for engineering colleges. Officials said that last year 22,000 seats had been vacant after the final admission round. The ACPC has decided that after two rounds of admission, it will let the management of colleges fill vacant seats.

To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and several appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season.Today's focus: App DesigningToday there is an application for anything. App design is a career worth pursuing, say expertsThe average time spent by an Indian on a smartphone each day is 169 minutes, says a study. And, most of this time is spent on social networking, gaming, browsing, e-mailing, and making transactions. Whether it's a smartphone or a tablet, all of these activities are possible just from one device because of the various applications (apps). Today, there is an application for almost everything, and app-designing is a career worth aspiring.In the past five-six years, the smartphone industry has evolved drastically. While development in hardware is changing rapidly, it is the software, especially the applications, that makes a smartphone more appealing. ""Five years ago, app-design was more about Java games and website design. The focus was on desktop applications and utility apps. Mobile and utility apps. Mobile applications become the focus when the smartphone industry boomed and companies started conducting hackathons to recruit people,"" says R Nadarajan, head, department of applied mathematics and computational sciences, PSG College of Technology.App-design has many components. ""There are many factors that a designer needs to consider. The target group, the aim of the app, the functionalities, its novelty, and profitability and ingenuity are to be analysed. The very thought of the general public using the app keeps any developer motivated,"" Nadarajan says.App design has come a long way. Today, mobile applications are an integral part of our life, as they track your movement, activities, and, at any point, provide a range of information on you, at one tap. ""The apps of today are aimed at all facets of life that one can think of and the focus has been on optimisation, cost reduction and improved user experience. Integr tion of data mining and artificial intelligence have played a major a role in providing quality service to users,"" he says. There are apps a dealing with all facets of life like entertainment, communication, online buying, health, and money. While there are specific courses on app-design, predominantly , most courses are electives or subjects included in the curriculum of circuit engineering branches (electronics, electrical, computer science and information technology). ""We have courses offered in the form of open electives to the students of various branches of engineering and technology, on Android app development and iOS n apps development. These course duration is 45 to 60 hours,"" the principal of Bannari Amman Institute of Technoloogy, Sathyamangalam, Erode, D Saravanan says. There are also courses offered online for beginners. ""A plethora of courses are available on Udacity, Youtube, Coursera, and Lynda. Its best recommended for any beginner,"" Nadarajan says.Besides courses, colleges also train students on app-designing. ""We organise hands-on workshops for students. There are online tutorials for students to be in touch with updated technology. And, the best part is making them participate in national and international contests,"" says the head of the computer science and engineering department, Kumaraguru College of Technology, Coimbatore, P Devaki.With over 10 billion mobile internet devices expected to be in use by 2016, the mobile app industry will grow tremendously to match the demand and keep up with ever evolving technologies, say professors. ""Social networking, mobile commerce, context aware marketing, location based services, mobile payment systems and object recognition systems widen up the field's scope,"" says Nadarajan."
"Now, university students to evaluate teachers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Now-university-students-to-evaluate-teachers/articleshow/52226431.cms,"NEW DELHI: The contentious Academic Performance Indicators (API) that had the university teaching community up in arms across the country since 2010 has been modified and made flexible with onus back on teaching while caps on various sub-categories of research has been removed.Also for the first time student feedback has been introduced. Only students with 75% or more attendance will be able to evaluate their teachers. UGC will shortly notify the modified API. Sources said, ""The existing API despite few amendments in the past was not favourable to teachers who only do teaching and was also resulting in poor quality research and publication in all sorts of academic journals.""In the new API, under the category of teaching/learning/evaluation a teacher will have to annually get 100 points at the level of assistant professor, 90 at the level of associate professor and 80 for professors. Student evaluation has been introduced and the five sub-categories of earlier API has been made four. Categories of co-curricular activities and research earlier evaluated together will now be evaluated individually as well as collectively depending on certain factors. Sources said that in the earlier API too much subjectivity was involved in case of co-curricular activities with college principals and vice-chancellors often acting as final authority. Now it has been simplified and scores have been reduced. Also, evaluation of these two categories will not be done annually. Even new field of co-curricular activity has been introduced to inculcate value education. The new fields are sports, NSS, NCC, field trips and few others.In case of research, sub-categories remain the same but cap of minimum score from each sub-category has been removed. For instance, in earlier API a teacher had to get 55% from research papers/publications, 20% from research projects, 10% from research guidance/undergraduate dissertations and 15% from training course and conference/seminars. Now a teacher can score from any sub-category. Also, to ensure that research papers are not published in shady journals, UGC will be listing out the name of peer-reviewed national and international journals where publications can take place. Also, for the first time research journals in Indian languages will be included."

The UGC had last year instructed the institites to appoint gender champions among students to foster equal treatment for both the genders on the campus. The aim was to achieve gender equality in the educational institutions. There was, however, no specific instruction about the third gender.Now, a letter from UGC secretary Jaspal Sandhu on April 5 has directed all the universities and colleges to involve the third gender in the scheme that promotes active participation of students.The communication this time came through the women and child development ministry.Medha Nanivadekar, the director of the Centre for Women's Studies at the Shivaji University, Kolhapur said this was a welcome move by the UGC and will encourage third gender to participate in the academic activities. ""Last year's UGC instrction for the gender champions scheme did not mention third gender and it was, in a way, was exclusive. But with the option of third gender, it is now inclusive,"" she told TOI.Nanivadekar said there were no specific statistics available with the SUK about the number of third gender students and it would be interesting to see how many actually exercise the option.University officials have forwarded the letter to the principals of all affiliated colleges to ensure that the instructions were followed. An SUK official said Sandhu's letter on August 3, 2015 had stated that the UGC expected gender champions to strengthen the potential of young girls and boys to advocate gender equality and monitor progress towards gender justice and create a society that is gender sensitive and values girls and their rights. ""It has now been amended with to include the third gender,"" the official said.The commission had asked colleges and universities to nominate a student as gender champion on the campus. The elected students were to be in charge of identifying gender bias, if any, in classrooms, observe the reasons for gender inequality and suggest measures to promote gender equality. ""The inclusion of transgender into the mainstream academics is a bold move by the UGC. I personally support it. We need to know the actual meaning of gender equality that also involves transgenders,"" said Abhishek Sant, an under-graduate student.""Though the UGC's initiative is a good move, its implementation at college- or the university-level willl be a challenging task,"" said Uttam Patil, who is also graduating from SUK."

What they fail to realize is that the child will not only be stressed out, but also battle anxiety issues.

Bihar gets central agriculture university while Parliament makes history,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Bihar-gets-central-agriculture-university-while-Parliament-makes-history/articleshow/52243897.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what could possibly be a rare example of passing a Bill by both Houses of Parliament the same day, both Rajya Sabha andLok Sabha passed the Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University Bill on Wednesday. Even the President Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent to it the same day - making it a rarest of the rare case in Parliamentary history.The legislation, meant for upgrading the existing Rajendra Agriculture University (RAU), Pusa, Samastipur in Bihar as a central university, gave the state its first central agriculture university. ""The central agriculture university is a big gift for the people of Bihar. It has fulfilled their long pending demand"", said the Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. Bihar, happens to be the minister's home state, recently also got the Mahatma Gandhi Central University in Motihari. Singh told TOI: ""It is honour to the state which got two central universities, including one central agriculture university, in the name of two great men - Mahatma Gandhi and Rajendra Prasad"". The legislation, a historical one for Bihar, will also be remembered as one of the rare Bills which could not only be passed by both houses of Parliament on the same day but also got the President's assent the same day. ""Passing of a Bill by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day can be done by waiving of rules (like giving minimum time to members of other House to vet it through prior notice). After all, House is the master of the Bill. If a House decides to take up a particular Bill the same day, it can take it up"", said PDT Achary, constitutional expert and former Lok Sabha secretary general. Asked by TOI to recall any other Bill which might have been passed by both Houses of the Parliament on the same day, Achary said though couple of Bills might have been passed in similar situation in the past, he could not recall any such case at least in recent past.The Bill was first passed by the Rajya Sabha and hours later, the Lok Sabha also approved it unanimously without any discussion on Wednesday. Since the Lok Sabha was to adjourn sine die on Wednesday itself, the minister was keen to get it approved. The Bill was introduced in the Upper House in December last year.According to new legislation, the headquarters of the university will remain in Pusa, Bihar. It will have powers to establish campuses at such other places within its jurisdiction as it may deem fit provided the university should integrate the existing campus and other associated facilities of the RAU."

If the governemnt doesn't listen, teachers may even boycott the admission process.Teachers argue that the changes are likely to impact quality of teaching and global rankings worldwide; lead to massive retrenchment of teachers and a ""skewed"" student-teacher ratio.The gazette notification increases the workload for assistant professors from 16 hours of ""direct teaching"" per week (including tutorials) to 18 hours plus another six of tutorials, bringing the total up to 24 hours. Similarly the work hours of associate professors has increased from 14 to 22. ""Tutorials have been made optional and practicals devalued by counting only one hour for every two. This will drastically reduce the individual attention that students can get and will lead to a significant lowering of standards,"" says a statement from the DUTA which is coordinating with national-level teachers associations to initiate a movement.Physics teacher and elected member to DU's exective council, Abha Dev Habib argues that the over 50% increase in workload for existing permanent teachers will mean ""a proportionate amount of retrenchment of ad hocs and temporary staff."" ""It means that very few of the students currently in research will get hired and that, in turn, could lead to fewer students joining higher education,"" she says adding, ""We are certain this is the direct result of the over 50% fund cut for the UGC.""The DUTA will also hold a general body meeting on Saturday, May 28, to decide on further course of action and also review the decision on the boycott. ""We don't want to boycott, nor delay results. But if the government wants the results to come early, let them consider our demands. This gazette notification treats two practical classes as one. All ad hoc teachers -- 3,000-4,000 of them -- may find themselves without jobs. Even permanent may faculty in certain departments may become surplus,"" says Rajesh Jha of Academics for Action and Development."

Marks obtained in class XII board examinations will no more influence a candidate's position on merit lists in medical admissions. But, scoring 50% in class XII board exams remains the minimum eligibility requirement to apply for admissions in medical courses, confirmed officials of the state health department. Officials said that unless the Centre intervenes, all admissions in medical courses will be completely based on NEET scores from this year onwards. Officials further said that CBSE, which is conducting the NEET examination, will be sending a separate merit list to the state, and each state will be able to fill up their own quota following the merit list. There will be a common merit list at the national level for the 15% all India quota.Health minister Nitin Patel said that he, along with education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, will go to Delhi and ask the Union government to intervene so that relying solely upon NEET is not made compulsory for this year. The Gujarat government would also move for NEET conducted in Gujarati.The state government will also ask the Centre to remove any cut-off criteria, or at least lower the cut-off criteria for students from Gujarat. ""We will also make representation that the 85% seats in the state barring the 15% all India quota, be filled with students who have appeared for their examination from Gujarat,"" said Nitin Patel.The Admission Committee for Medical and Paramedical Courses (ACMPC) had earlier prepared a merit list based on the marks obtained in the class XII examination and also the marks obtained in Gujarat Common Entrance Test in the ratio of 60% and 40%. This will now have no impact on medical stream admissions.Apart from the 15% all India quota, said officials, the state will be able to admit their own students in 85% remaining seats. To allay apprehensions that GSHSEB students might be edged out by students from other boards, with NEET becoming mandatory, officials said the state's quota of 85% seats will be filled on the pro-rata basis earlier followed by ACMPC."

In high demand: From fine ideas to working models,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/In-high-demand-From-fine-ideas-to-working-models/articleshow/52299723.cms,"It's that time of the year again, when students have to make choices that will define their careers. To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and several appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season. Today's focus: Industrial DesignEver broken a toy car to see how it actually works? Or wondered how a three-legged stool balances itself or how a bicycle moves? If you spent your childhood pondering over how things work or tearing things down, industrial or product design might be the right choice for you.Industrial designers develop concepts and designs for products. They specialise in one product category, such as automobile, furniture or housewares. While product design is often confused with industrial design, experts say product design is a sub topic. Industrial design encompasses anything man-made right from products to complete ecosystems.""With Make in India, innovation has become the buzzword and design thinking is key to innovation,"" said BK Chakravarthy, professor, head and institute chair professor, industrial design centre (IDC) at IIT Bombay. With technology taking centre stage in most fields, Chakravarthy says students are taught to use design thinking and problem solving skills to address users' needs. From designing a residential garbage collection device to a waterfetching aid for rural women; using ceramics and glass to design housewares; working with leather to design car seats; building an entertainment console for a vehicle; a motorcycle helmet design; design for a metro train or using animation to narrate stories -the possibilities are endless.Most colleges have an entrance exam such as the CEED which is held annually by IITs and the Indian Institute of Science. The test is designed to gauge one's visual thinking, creativity and comprehension skills. Experts suggest maintaining a portfolio of any work that would show an inclination for design.Through the course, students learn to work with different materials using various machines such as looms, dying machines, printing machines, metal and woodwork. Courses are designed to focus on green manufacture or sustainability. Students are trained to go through the process of converting an idea into a reality.A course in industrial design is not just about design though. In most colleges, students get to choose sub disciplines. For example, at Srishti School of Design, while the first year is all about building the foundation, in the 2nd and 3rd years, students can choose which studio they want to work in. ""Each discipline offer studios and workshops such as photography, camera for films, public space design, electronics, etc. So a student is free to follow his interest and see how it pairs with industrial design,"" said Naga Nandini, course leader, Industrial Arts and Design Practices at Srishti School of Design.At IDC, besides tailor-made courses that can be pursued based on one's interest, the course is project oriented. ""We try to find practical solutions to real-life issues and a lot depends on how well we understand the end user,"" said Chakravarthy. For one of their project, students at IDC designed signages for a hospital in the city as part of their project work.What is key to success in a design career is curiosity and the ability to think in a multi-directional view, say experts. The world is a freeway for industrial designers, say experts. From leading a design team as chief design officer to heading an R&D; team in any field or going the start-up way by becoming an entrepreneur, the options are numerous."
"'Common entrance tests for MBBS, BDS will go'",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Common-entrance-tests-for-MBBS-BDS-will-go/articleshow/52251408.cms,"Madurai: All steps will be taken to abolish the common entrance tests for medical and BDS courses which are against the welfare of poor rural students, and it was the DMK that was a part of the UPA government in 2010 when the notification was issued for conducting the common entrance test, said chief minister J Jayalalithaa. Addressing a poll campaign meeting in Tirunelveli on Thursday, she said it was her government which had taken steps to ensure that the common entrance tests were abolished and a special act was enacted to protect the welfare of the rural students. It was in the interest of these students that the AIADMK government issued an order to do away with entrance tests for these courses. In 2006, a special act was enacted for the same issue and the selection for the medical and BDS courses were conducted based only on the plus two results since 2007.The Medical Council of India announced that a nationwide entrance examination should be conducted for entry into these professional courses on Dec 27, 2010, which was opposed by many state governments. ""The efforts taken by the government headed by me resulted in the Supreme Court dismissing the MCI order on July 18, 2013,"" she said. But the former UPA government, in which the DMK was a part, filed a review petition in the court. Now, in another case a three-judge bench has ordered that a common test be conducted throughout the country on May 9, 2016.DMK leader M Karunanidhi, who was in the habit of seeking political gains out of any situation, was now blaming the AIADMK government, saying that it had not argued the case properly in the Supreme Court, when it was the DMK which had been a part of the UPA government when the MCI passed the order for a common entrance test in 2010, she said.Listing out the benefits brought to the people by her government, Jayalalithaa said every single vote that went to the DMK would be something that was going against the welfare of the people and the children of the state.All our schemes have been aimed at uplifting the poor people of the state, while the DMK manifesto was one that had been chalked out to fool the people."
Dentist surplus forces freeze on new colleges in India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Dentist-surplus-forces-freeze-on-new-colleges-in-India/articleshow/52317522.cms,"MUMBAI: Unemployment has entered the health sciences sector. With supply outstripping demand and no work for new dental graduates, India has decided to stop all new dental colleges. The firm stand was taken recently at the general body meeting of the Dental Council of India which grants permission to new institutes. The decision follows requests from several existing colleges that wanted the council to reject fresh proposals for more institutes, as well as the high rate of unemployment among dentists.India currently has 309 dental colleges, which churn out around 26,000 dentists every year. The count was as high as 30,570 in 2010. In 1970, only 8,000 dental students graduated annually.  ""It would be a good idea to consolidate our numbers now and strengthen the existing institutes,"" said Dr Mansing Pawar, DCI member and dean of Government Dental College. An exception could be made for states like those in the north-east that do not have any dental college, he added.   Some estimates suggest that India has 3 lakh dentists, but there is an imbalance in their spread. In 2004, India had one dentist per 10,000 people in urban areas and one dentist per 2.5 lakh people in the rural areas. It was not long ago that the good times were rolling for dentists. It is now, however, estimated that there will be a surplus of more than 1 lakh dentists in India by 2020. The DCI, on its part, has been trying to trim growth for some time now. In the last two years, it has only permitted new colleges with an attached medical institute to foray into the dental stream. But that was not enough.""Mushrooming of dental colleges in the past few years in India has led to unemployment among Indian dentists. Thousands of dentists are coming out every year with very low prospects of jobs,"" noted Namrata Dagli in her paper 'Increasing unemployment among Indian dental graduates'.Former acting DCI president Dr Mahesh Verma, who is the current director of the Maulana Azad Dental College, said the time has come to ""not vitiate the problem and build on what we have"".""Over the years, we have created a huge manpower of dentists and job avenues have shrunk. There is not much opportunity for today's passouts, except if they want to start their own practice, which too isn't easy. It needs money, space, infrastructure and the right attitude,"" he added.""Self-practice in urban areas is not very easy due to saturation of the dental market. In rural areas, private clinics are not viable because of low awareness of oral health among the rural population. Dental graduates are facing serious financial constraint. Unemployed dentists are left with no choice but to quit their profession and work in call centres or commit suicide,"" added Dagli, in her paper which appeared in the Journal of International Oral Health."

A bench of Justices A R Dave, Shiva Kirti Singh and A K Goel said NEET does not infringe upon the rights of state governments or private institutions and that the single-window test must be applied from the current academic year itself. The bench also asked the three-member oversight committee, headed by former Chief Justice R M Lodha, to oversee NEET-II. Several states, universities and private colleges conducted entrance tests in the last fortnight when the SC was hearing their pleas to allow them to admit students on the basis of their tests, but Monday's order nullifies them. Now they will have to follow NEET and admit students on the basis of their performance in the single-window test.Although NEET II is scheduled for July 24, the Supreme Court allowed CBSE and Centre to reschedule the examination date in case of logistical problems. Exams by AIIMS, PGIMER will be validThe Supreme Court bench on Monday made it clear that those students who had appeared for NEET-I held on May 1 would be allowed to take second phase of NEET but their marks in previous test would stand scrapped. ""To allay any such apprehension, we direct that all eligible candidates who could not appear in NEET-I or have apprehensions that they had not prepared well, be permitted to appear in NEET-II, subject to seeking an option from the said candidates to give up their candidature for NEET-I,"" it said. However, examinations conducted by AIIMS and PGIMER for their MBBS seats would go on as they are regulated by Central legislation. ""Prima facie, we do not find any infirmity in the NEET regulation on the ground that it affects the rights of the states or the private institutions. Special provisions for reservation of any category are not subject matter of NEET nor rights of minorities are in any manner affected by NEET. NEET only provides for conducting entrance test for eligibility for admission to the MBBS/BDS courses,"" the bench said. The top court refused to modify its April 28 order which directed implementation of NEET for 2016-17 academic year itself. It said that NEET only provides for conducting entrance tests and it did not violate special provisions on reservation in colleges and rights of minority institutions. ""To ensure total credibility of the examination to be held by CBSE, the oversight committee appointed by this court shall also oversee NEET-II examination to be conducted by CBSE,"" it said."

The WCD ministry, in conjunction with the HRD and health ministries, runs the NDA's flagship 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme which aims at ending female foeticide and promoting the education of girls.  In her note to Irani, Maneka wrote, ""When it comes to sending children for higher education, parents often distinguish between girls and boys... The girls often get denied the privilege of higher education or specialised courses only because parents do not wish to take a loan for their daughter's education.""

Moreover teachers who focused more on teaching than say on extracurricular activities like refereeing a basketball match sometimes found themselves at a disadvantage,"" another HRD official said.In several colleges, including many in rural areas, the adequate support for research is not there, officials said.We have reduced the rigidity of the previous system and decided that co-curricular activities and research would be measured separately as well as together and there will be no capping in research.Activities like presentation of paper on various subjects will also be given weightage.""The main focus of the changes that we are bringing in this criteria is that a teacher's performance should be linked with - how well does he teach,"" a senior HRD official said."

""I was more focussed on my board exams and I take one step at a time. It is important to focus on one thing at a time to excel in life. Now that I am through my exams I will take some time out and decide what I really want to pursue. I have appeared for few engineering entrance exams and after their result I will take the final call,"" she added. Sukriti has scored a total of 497 out of 500. She scored 100 in Physics and Chemistry, and 99 in English, Maths and Computer Science.  Born and brought up in Delhi, Sukriti followed a basic routine and never emphasised on the concept of studying for long hours. ""I never studied for any specific number of hours. I focussed more on utilising those hours in doing something productive. The credit goes to my school teachers for constantly helping me out and my parents who stood by my side as the pillar of strength,"" said Sukriti. Her mother Renuka Gupta was a Physics topper of her batch and father Rakesh Gupta was a Rajasthan board topper. ""I am feeling great. We never pushed her hard to emerge as a topper and constantly kept motivating her to do better. Now that she has topped on All India level the feeling is great,"" said Renuka Gupta. Unlike many students who would isolate themselves during board exams, Sukriti says she enjoyed every aspect of her life. ""I used to watch TV, play games and travel even during my boards. I don't think so isolating yourself will help. You can't study all the time as it becomes tiring after certain point of time so there is a need for extra curricular activities to keep your mind fresh,"" she said."

The protests continued on Thursday, a day after vice-chancellor V K Jain told TOI that the university authorities were ""open to reviewing and examining"" the provisions in the prospectus which students find harsh.

However, in this case vice-chancellor RL Hangloo, appointed by this government, has threatened to resign alleging political interference on the issue of method to be adopted for admission.Even as political parties across ideological divide, including BJP, are ranged against Hangloo, he himself did many flip-flops on Wednesday. First he blamed the Centre for interfering in university's admission policy but later changed it to political interference in general.While talking to presspersons, Hangloo said, ""HRD ministry should not have interfered. We will all have to leave and let the university be run by government as it wishes. Then it would be better to have MLAs and MPs as vice-chancellors rather than academics."" In no time he issued a clarification by taking an unprecedented decision. Hangloo sent a letter to Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari stating that neither HRD minister Smriti Irani nor ministry officials have ever interfered in the working of the university.He blamed media for twisting his statements. By evening Hangloo was back to blaming political parties, including BJP for mess in Allahabad University. ""This is a central university and used to be called the Oxford of the East in the past. There can be no possibility of the institution regaining its lost glory if political interference continues,"" Hangloo said.Allahabad University had introduced admission only through online method this year. However, many BJP MPs met Irani on Tuesday and sought her intervention. After ministry sent him a missive that offline test should also be there, university had to modify its earlier decision. However ministry sources said it had merely suggested that online tests can be introduced from next year.Student leaders across political divide had opposed only online admission test. Leaders were alleging that online test will intrinsically benefit urban and semi-urban students while those from rural background will be left behind because of lack of internet connectivity.The matter came up in Rajya Sabha. Irani sparred with SP leader Ramgopal Yadav. She alleged SP leaders had threatened Hangloo while he cited VC's statement alleging interference from the Centre."

"'Introduce NEET in engg courses, but keep students in mind'",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Introduce-NEET-in-engg-courses-but-keep-students-in-mind/articleshow/52265381.cms,"The National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) has been made mandatory for entrance to medical colleges. Students, faculty and those in the field of education voice their opinion about introducing a common all-India entrance examination for engineering courses as well. While some say it should be introduced, others feel NEET is not required for engineering examinations.Form an apex body to frame common syllabiIt would be better if there's a common entrance for engineering aspirants as well at the all-India level. Instead of writing many exams to get into B.Tech courses, conducting only one test throughout the country will relieve both students and parents from stress. However, before starting a countrywide test, one must ensure that the syllabus is the same for all states. Moreover, conducting the test in the regional languages would help those students who have been studying in their vernacular languages. At present, there are all-India entrance examinations conducted by IITs, BITs and other deemed universities. But the disparities in syllabi of these examinations make the students reel under undue pressure. Therefore, there should be an apex body at the all-India level for framing of the syllabus and preparation of question paper. - K Rama Mohan Rao, Academician NEET not required for engineeringEven though making NEET mandatory for entrance to medical courses would be a boon for students, there's no need to extend the same for the engineering courses because in India, we already have two all-India exams for IIT and NIT, which has around 10,000 and 20,000 seats respectively. Besides, the states conduct Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) for admissions to the engineering courses. The two states of AP and Telangana have 3.2 lakh seats in engineering and students need to qualify EAMCET to get into a good engineering college. There are enough engineering colleges unlike the limited number of medical seats and good medical colleges. - G Ramalingeswara Rao, College deanNEET syllabus has a holistic approachThe stand taken by the central government and upheld by the Supreme Court on NEET is a welcome one and is expected to bring benefits to all stakeholders including students, parents, professionals and the general public. NEET would obviate reasonably the problems arising out of the present system in terms of quality and competency. I support NEET for engineering courses as well for the same reasons. Having a national syllabus gives a holistic approach to education, equity and improved access to education. Writing one engineering examination instead of multiple ones for different institutes would be easier for students as well. However, keeping NEET in view, upgradation of plus two syllabus is also required. - KVL Raju, Engineering college principal Financial burden on students will reduceStudents prepare for various entrance examinations after finishing their Intermediate to get seats in top colleges like IIT, NIT or other deemed universities. Parents also spend a lot of money for their children's education and for various coaching centres. If NEET is introduced for engineering courses, the financial burden faced by students would be reduced to some extent. The expenditure incurred by parents for their children's entrance preparations would also come down because there will be only one common examination for all engineering colleges. - M Mahesh, StudentTwo exams for engineering requiredStudents have to face a lot of problems regarding entrance examinations. After our Intermediate, we have to write several examinations like AIEEE, EAMCET, B.ARCH, NATA and so on to get into a good college/university. Along with these examinations, there are also university entrance examinations. Writing only one test like NEET may help reduce the burden, but it should also ensure that the deserving students irrespective of their caste get a fair chance to get admissions to a good college. Also, for engineering, I feel it's better to conduct a specific examination for a particular engineering/medical discipline. For example, NATA is only for architecture. That way, students would be writing only two tests - one to get into engineering and the second to get into the course of his/her choice. - Kolli Manju, StudentInterest of the aspirants matters mostThere is already a national eligibility-cum-entrance test for admissions to IIT and NIT by the name JEE and it is conducted by the central government. As per the existing provisions, institutions of engineering and medicine can be established by the Centre as well as the states with the approval of UGC/MCI as the case may be. If the basic idea is to bring in quality medical education, the Union government may first take over all the government medical colleges in the states and then proceed for NEET on the lines of JEE. Every step should be taken within the constitutional limits and always keeping in view the interests of the aspirants. - G V Ramana Murthy, Retired railway employee.For the coming week, we turn the spotlight on Vizag's Old Town.

Health dept looks at detailed health as subject in school,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Health-dept-looks-at-detailed-health-as-subject-in-school/articleshow/52347595.cms,"BENGALURU: Concerned about increasing lifestyle diseases, especially among youngsters, the health department is looking at introducing health as a subject for school children.While the proposal is in the preliminary stages, UT Khader, health minister, said that the department was looking at introducing the subject in schools during the coming academic year.Speaking on the sidelines of the 115th anniversary celebration of Shathayu Ayurvedic treatment centres, Khader said parents played an important role in ensuring the health of the future generation, but today's parents were either not fully aware or did not have the time.""If not at home, the idea is to teach children about health at least at school. It is not enough to simply tell them to wash hands before and after eating, or to have a shower everyday. These will be covered in primary sections- but as the child grows, they also need to be taught about how, for example, sugar affects their body, what metabolism is, what they can do to improve metabolism, lifestyle diseases and how to protect oneself from them and so on,"" Khader said.According to Khader, the lack of guidance and awareness was also contributing the increasing diseases. ""Everyone is a doctor today and suggests anti- biotics for various diseases. There used to be a time when plants were used to cure minor illnesses like cold or cough and so on. Today nobody even remembers these plants which had huge medicinal value,"" he said. He added that the role of Ayurvedic medicine was especially important considering that it also focused on preventing factors that caused many lifestyle diseases. ""Although Ayurveda is often considered the last resort in medicinal treatment, with greater awareness and more accessibility, it could become the first, at least for minor illnesses,"" he said.In an effort to make Ayurvedic medicine more accessible and affordable, the health department has proposed to construct 50 bed Ayurvedic hospitals within the campus of District hospitals across the state and 10 bed Ayurvedic centres in taluk hospitals as well.Construction of hospitals in Chitradurga and Mangalore was sanctioned in the last budget and will begin this year, he added.Former health minister HC Mahadevappa observed that close to 25-30% of our children were malnourished. ""What kind of nation can we build when our children are not healthy?"" he asked, adding that Ayurveda had simple solutions in medicinal plants which were also not expensive. Liver care and management: Improving the health of our livers will improve our overall health, according to Dr Mruthyunjaya Swamy, Managing Director, Shathayu Ayurveda.""Today's health concerns are lifestyle diseases as opposed to infectious diseases, which is reducing thanks to advancements in medicine. Toxins in food are absorbed by our liver, which becomes sluggish, causing metabolism related problems. Eventually, the liver becomes unable to even absorb the medicines we are taking,"" he said.As part of its liver care and management programme, Shathayu will not only provide focused treatment, but will also begin awareness and training programme for doctors in liver care.Over time, the plan is to expand research into pain management, women and child and infertility issues, he added.Shathayu has also dedicated an 8 acre property to grow and develop medicinal plants."

Senior Brianna Suslovic started the project this year after seeing Harvard grapple with its history in other ways. Harvard recently replaced the job title ""house master"" following complaints that it was tied to slavery, and Harvard's law school abandoned its crest over its ties to an 18th century slaveholder. Students say their research adds context to similar ongoing debates."

The agency presented their case before the GU vice chancellor on Monday.The Gujarat University had recently issued a show cause notice to the agency for the delay in declaring the semester I and III results of BA and BCom courses.The GU has now decided to take action against professors who have made errors in summing marks and created mistakes in total marks given to examinees.In their response the agency pointed out errors both in total marks on answer sheets as well as in summing marks on individual questions. As the agency is supposed to check all totals before preparing the final results, it fell in a tight spot.It is worth recalling that after the gold medal scam in Gujarat University in which three TY BCom students were found to have increased their marks through underhand deals with agency employees, police had arrested three employees of Shree Computer Agency. After that, the GU decided not to rely totally on the agency for preparing final mark sheets, and held that tabulation will first be made by the professors evaluating the papers, and later the agency will also prepare a similar sheet for final mark sheets."

Irani unveils web platform for inclusive higher edu,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Irani-unveils-web-platform-for-inclusive-higher-edu/articleshow/52033877.cms,"NEW DELHI: The HRD ministry has unveiled an ambitious plan to facilitate web-based learning, involving applying for courses and accessing material online, to increase the reach and quality of higher education. HRD minister Smriti Irani in a tweet outlined the structure of Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (Swayam) which promises linkages and assistance for web-enabled learning. The massive open online courses (MOOCS) platform will aim to create a student experience that begins with creating learning plans and providing information to prospective students about the courses that are available. The Swayam flow chart will allow students to check their eligibility and then proceed for preview and availability of teaching in fields of their interest. The next step is contact with course coordinators for more detailed information. Application and successful registration lead to access to course materials as the learning process gets under way and now, as students begin following schedules, they can network with other learners to set up a shared workspace. These workspaces can be homes or any available public space and the interaction can go up with online communication with other course-takers. Mid-module assessments and guidance from supervisors are intended to keep students on track and up to the mark in their academic work that includes self-assessment. Successful course completion will lead to earning credits followed by a course review exercise and the next level of learning in the programme will get under way. Completion of requisite number of modules will lead to qualification at par with regular learning. The elearning programme has been structured to deliver results and improve inclusion as the admission processes to colleges and schools are unable to accommodate a growing number of applicants."

School principals share IIM learnings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/School-principals-share-IIM-learnings/articleshow/52133405.cms,"NEW DELHI: The 60 school principals, teacher educators and officials who attended leadership training at Indian Institute of Management (Lucknow) in April 2016, have gained as much from interacting with each other as the programme itself.In a meeting with the education minister, Manish Sisodia, on Thursday, they related what worked for them, what didn't and the changes they planned after the sessions. Principals have planned meetings with mothers, story-writing sessions and student elections in schools although some were a touch skeptical about being instructed by a business school.The principals wished their trainers were more conversant with the circumstances in which they function and the extreme poverty many of their students live in. The principal of a boys' school in Tikri Kalan organised for extra water supply with the Vidyalaya Kalyan Samiti funds because many of his students came from homes where there was none. ""I asked them to bring extra bottles and fill for home as well,"" he told Sisodia and officials to unanimous appreciation but admitted that this measure was taken before the training.Several presentations were planned -- the teachers have returned with formidable PPT skills and a veritable lexicon of b-school cliches -- Sisodia asked speakers to cut through the 'theory' and get to ""concrete steps"" they have taken, motivated by the programme. Kavita Rana introduced ""class panchayat elections"" in her school, Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Vasant Vihar. ""We set up an election aayog, even had election symbols and students filed nominations,"" said Rana. Sarita Batra has decided on a ""mothers meeting"" at the Sultanpuri School she heads. Director, education, Saumya Gupta suggested including fathers too because ""mothers are inherently enlightened"" and ""fathers pose a bigger challenge."" Batra also intends to start a ""story-writing and story-telling"" initiative. ""Stories have more impact than debates or discussion. Children will write stories that'll be with others in the assembly. I'll also encourage the habit of reading. There are kids who finish school without ever checking a book out from our library,"" she said.However, feedback on the programme, was not entirely positive. ""We need to know what was good and what was bad about the programme. And we'll communicate it to IIM and the teams from IIM Ahmedabad and Cambridge University who'll be in Delhi soon,"" said Sisodia encouraging school leaders to ""be critical.""Batra pointed out that the content ""had to be specific."" ""We asked the organisers why they didn't take information from us before starting, ask us what we expected,"" she said and a rumble of assent went through the crowd. ""It should have been conducted in two rounds with time in between for us to test our skills and give feedback. Also, they should call a person from our background, who worked in the same conditions but did extremely well."" Seema Srivastava, from the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) agreed that the trainers deployed at IIM ""didn't know much about government schools."" But presentations from teachers, told SCERT ""where the gaps are and how they may be addressed."""

MBBS admissions: Pvt medical colleges in Telangana flout SC directive on single entrance,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/MBBS-admissions-Pvt-medical-colleges-in-Telangana-flout-SC-directive-on-single-entrance/articleshow/51995921.cms,"HYDERABAD: By its decision to conduct separate web-based entrance for admissions into MBBS course, the consortium of non-minority Telangana Private Medical Colleges' Management Association (TPMCMA) seem to be on a collision course with Supreme Court of India. This is the view that is now gaining currency after the apex court in a landmark decision in April first week recalled its 2013 judgment in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (the ruling had then allowed private colleges to conduct their separate entrance). While the latest judgment cleared the way for common medical entrance tests for admissions, TPMCMA is set to do exactly the opposite as it is still going ahead with its private medical entrance test (MCET-2016) on May 20 to fill up 735 MBBS seats (35%) under 'B' category management seats in dozen private medical colleges for 2016-17 in Telangana. ""For both payment seats in private colleges or free seats in government medical colleges, there should be a common entrance test to fill up MBBS seats to prevent fleecing by private medical colleges on the name of capitation fees and to ensure selection of candidates take place only by merit,"" said Dr K Ramesh Reddy, Medical Council of India (MCI) member, while welcoming the Supreme Court judgment. In all, there are 2,950 MBBS seats in Telangana state including 850 seats in five government medical colleges, while the remaining 2,100 seats are offered by private colleges. These 2,100 seats are again sub-divided into three categories: 50% seats (1050) filled by the state government under convenor quota through integrated Engineering, Agricultural and Medical Common Entrance Test (EAMCET), 35 % seats (735) through private entrance test and for remaining 15% NRI quota, the seats go to highest bidders. In fact, Andhra Pradesh Private Medical Colleges' Management Association (APPMCMA) too is conducting a separate online entrance test on May 13 to fill up its share of 35% 'B' category management MBBS seats in 13 private medical colleges for 2016-17. ""It looks funny but MBBS aspirants in both AP and T take admissions in colleges through three different modes. There can be one EAMCET for all as this would bring in transparency in the way MBBS seats are filled up in private colleges, which resort to corruption to make money,"" said Dr YV Rajasekhar Reddy, a US returned doctor cum parent. However, prof T Papi Reddy, chairman, chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education, under whose supervision the private medical entrance test is being conducted, clarified that even though ideally a single common entrance is welcome, the SC judgment has no bearing on Telangana state. ""The SC judgment in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) case does not apply to Telangana and AP as both states are exempted from contributing medical seats to 'central pool' (as is done by other states) under Article 371 (D), which safeguards educational rights of locals,"" he claimed. Even for NEET exam, which the Medical Council of India (MCI) mooted in 2013 and wants to conduct every year at the national level as a single common medical entrance test, he said that it may come into the picture from next academic year (2017-18) as it is too late for such an exam now. When contacted, C Laxminarsimha Rao, convenor, TPMCMA, said that their private medical entrance would be held as per schedule on May 20. ""For eight more years, private medical colleges in both the states would continue to have their own private entrance tests as under 371(D) three states of J&K;, AP and Telangana have been granted special previleges when it comes to education rights,"" he said. However, G Srinivas, president, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association, differed saying that irrespective of the exemptions given to AP and T under Article 371 (D), the spirit of SC judgment has to be followed by all the states. ""When private medical colleges in both AP and Telangana have no objection in having PGMET, a common medical entrance for postgraduate medical aspirants, why do they object to EAMCET as a common entrance test for MBBS,"" he asked."

From the earth, this phenomenon is seen when the mercury passes between the Sun and the Earth and this happens only when the Sun, the Mercury and the Earth are lined up. The Mercury appears as a dot on the solar disc because its angular size is very small as compared to the Sun as seen from the Earth.""The last transit of Mercury had occurred on November 2006 and it was visible only from eastern parts of India. The next transit of the Mercury that will be visible from India will occur on November 13, 2032. Extreme caution is advised while looking at the solar disc.

UGC head asks universities to focus on R&D;,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/UGC-head-asks-universities-to-focus-on-RD/articleshow/52043818.cms,"BELAGAVI: Prof Ved Prakash, chairman of University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi assured the universities that, as research and innovations are at the heart of developmental perspectives in higher education, UGC will support such activities in all the way and there is no death of resources for the same. He said there is serious need for insightful minds to undertake interdisciplinary research, which is the need of the hour.While addressing the 4th annual convocation of Rani Channamma University (RCU) here on Friday, Ved Prakash said innovation platform and innovation centres need to be established along with innovation and incubation parks, simultaneously participating in international collaboration.UGC head said quality of research lays the foundation for the recognition of the institutions in their global ranking. This is a subject of concern, as Indian universities need to improve their profiles, overcoming all barriers, which hamper the growth and development of high-end research.Skill development initiatives important:UGC head suggested universities that, although university as a system is for creation of new knowledge, but in the changing scenario, employability has also become an important concern. There is a need for enhancing skill development initiatives and implementing National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) for mobility between vocational and mainstream education. Industry academia interaction has been proverbially weak and needs to be strengthened involving Public Private Partnership (PPP) models, he said.Although this inter- linkage has been attempted, the research and development function through university- industry interface is not as prominent in the culture of Indian universities as it ought to be. The subject needs to be put on discourse to overcome barriers to a joint collaboration of curriculum and courses mutually relevant to both the university and industry. ""It may be worthwhile on the part of our university academics to make a detailed study on how this interface works effectively in the university system elsewhere in the world and outline strategies which can enhance such an interface with our industries in the country, and provide indigenous solutions to the problems critical for solution"" Ved Prakash opined.Further, he said education today is impoverished if it fails to utilize the orientation that can be provided to it by technology enabled interventions. There is a need to ensure connectivity amongst institutions of higher education through National Knowledge Network (NKN) which is now connecting 26,000 colleges/university/research laboratories. Another intervention is to exploit the National Mission on Education through ICT (NME-ICT) for qualitative improvement of curriculum transaction and exposure of teachers and students to the frontiers of knowledge, he said.Need to increase enrolment in government universities:It is interesting to note that 96% of enrolment in higher education is in the state and private university system. Any attempt at improving and consolidating the situation will require a new mission mode to incentivize state institutions based on academic, administrative and governance reforms. This problem is being addressed through the National Mission on Higher Education through Rashtriya Uchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) following the success of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamic Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) at the school levels, Ved Prakash said.This before, chancellor of the university, governor Vajubhai Vala conferred the gold medals to the rank holder students, presiding over the convocation.

Nearly 22k Karnataka schools have 2 or fewer teachers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Nearly-22k-Karnataka-schools-have-2-or-fewer-teachers/articleshow/52069489.cms,"BENGALURU: While the prescribed teacher-student ratio is 1:35, as many as 21,947 out of the 75,489 schools, including private ones, in Karnataka have just two or fewer teachers. According to the provisional figures for 2015-16 by District Information System for Education (DISE), 1,767 schools have no teachers at all, while 5,503 have only one and 14,667 have just two. Five educational districts have more than 100 schools with zero teachers: Kalaburgi (168), Bengaluru South (112) Tumakuru, Chikkamangaluru (104 each) and Mysuru (101). Primary and secondary education principal secretary Ajai Seth said: ""In many cases, that's because of drop in enrolment which allows us to move teachers to places where there are more students. Also the rule that we need to have one school for every kilometre has resulted in a lot of small schools (in terms of students)."" As for zero-teacher schools, he said: ""Those schools that have no students are not immediately shut down, we wait for a year or two and if the enrolment remains the same, we close them. But it doesn't mean we keep sending our teachers to schools with no students.""Minister Kimmane Ratnakar was unavailable for comments despite several attempts. Educationists say this is also an indication of the government's inability to fill seats as there are 45,000 unfilled seats in high schools alone. ""In the past three years, nearly 32,000 primary school teachers have retired. The government needs to immediately fill these posts and in future fill such posts in advance,"" Basavaraj Gurika, president, Karnataka Primary School Teachers Association said.Educationist Mohandas Pai said: ""There needs to be a lot of consolidation. You cannot try and have one school for every kilometre. It is like saying we need one university for each district. It won't work. A lot of schools with such few teachers must also have low student population as a lot of them are now migrating to other schools.""Seth agreed there are about 33,000 vacancies in primary schools, but said about 8,000 of them have been filled.""That is because the vacancies allowed were based on years when enrolment was high. However, from 2001-2011 the rural population has grown only 7% while the urban population has grown 34%. So there are many schools where we do not need teachers."" Pai also pointed out that 50% of primary school children enrolled in the state are with private schools and this is expected to increase. ""The same with other categories,"" he said.VP Niranjan Aradhya, fellow at the Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said, ""The problem is with the government looking at vacancies at the state and district level. That has to change. They have to look at vacancies at the school level.""TIMES VIEWGovernments must give priority to education because that's how futures are built. But when more than 25% of schools have just two or fewer teachers, it exposes the apathy of the government. It can rationalize that some don't have any teachers because there are no students — that begs the question why it has come to be — but what about institutions that have just one teacher? That teacher can't take a break or prepare for classes or do anything to add value or knowledge. Authorities must first wake up to this harsh reality, and then take steps to ensure that the next generations get a proper education. get a proper education."

""It has happened because I do not toe their ideological line. Wait for two more days I will expose them further,"" she saysThe entire controversy began in January this year when Kishwar asked Kumar if CSDS would give her affiliation for her fellowship. Kumar says, ""I verbally said it should not be a problem. I thought it was affiliation not any commitment to use office space."" She was asked to give a written request which she did. Kumar says, ""I told her that the decision will be taken by the standing committee of faculty members. Most of the decisions I take are through committees."" Kumar says Kishwar responded to this positively and said, ""It is good you like to do things this way. It has brought peace to CSDS. I am expecting few members not to be favourable but expect you to be fair and even-handed.""On January 14, meeting of the standing committee took place where it was decided that norms for self-governance will be defined and only after that decision on affiliation will be taken. On the same day, Kishwar wrote to Kumar asking him not to bother representing her application to ""this farcical standing committee and its farcical norms of self-governance."" She said ""matter"" should be left to her to ""figure out things for myself."" On April 30 she retired from CSDS and on May 2 it received the legal notice.Kishwar has dug out a list of 154 individuals who got affiliation from CSDS while availing some fellowship. However, the list has two names - social psychologist Ashis Nandy and political scientist D L Sheth - who also were ICSSR national fellows. ""CSDS went out of the way to accommodate them and gave affiliations in some cases for 15 years,"" she says.Kishwar says CSDS administration is lying. ""Rule of self-governance is a lie. They never wanted to give me affiliation. I know how lawless the place is."" She asks, ""How come an institute in existence for more than 50 years has no rule of self-governance? It is arbitrary. ICSSR fellows have never been denied affiliation."""

In another report on school education, standing committee asked HRD ministry to carry out a ground assessment of schools that are not giving 25% admission to children belonging to economically weaker sections. In case of mid-day meal, the parliamentary panel said that the amount paid to cooks is meagre and compensation should be brought to the level of MNREGA wages.  The panel has recommended that 25% of all government education funding or 1.5% of GDP be spent on higher education. It said that to achieve higher Gross Enrolment Ratio and for making India an educational hub globally, not only more allocations are required but the utilisation of allocations has to be more efficient. Parliamentary panel said this trend is ""certainly affecting the implementation of various schemes in the ministry"" and asked it to review its overall mechanism right from making the proposed demand till the final expenditure is incurred and also assess the impact as far as implementation of various schemes is concerned.""

Unique IIT-B survey finds 95% freshers are virgin,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Unique-IIT-B-survey-finds-95-freshers-are-virgin/articleshow/52101200.cms,"MUMBAI: A survey conducted on the IIT-Bombay campus for freshmen found 95% students had never had sex, but about 30% of them were in a relationship.Inspired by the Harvard Crimson freshmen survey, IIT-B's student newspaper — Insight — conducted a survey to appreciate the diversity of a freshman batch welcomed to the campus. The Powai campus for the first time looked at the beliefs and lifestyles of its incoming batch to find that most students were moderately liberal when it came to their political views and 75% of them were comfortable with the idea of homosexuality and/or homosexual marriages.The survey looked at diverse topics such as students' background before joining IIT, their political and religious beliefs and post-grad plans. In all, 254 of the 875 freshmen who entered through JEE participated in the survey.""The survey aimed to understand the institute's demographic better. It's important so we can see how we're growing as an institute and what demographic we are catering to,"" said Shreeyesh Menon, Insight chief editor. The quintessential IITian has changed over the years. A good 60% don't believe in religious practices and another 30% ""somewhat"" follow them. But when it comes to the idea of God, 18% are atheist, 35% are agnostic and 47% believe in God. Cellphone, largely a smartphone, is a necessity and spending at least 1.5 hours on a social networking site is on their must-do list.""Halfway into the first semester, every respondent was spending 1.6 hours on Facebook every day. The percentage of people not using Facebook at all decreased from 37.7% to 6%,"" the study noted.Kicked off in September, the long exercise included the planning and designing of questions, mailing them, collating information received and analysing it. The results were released on Tuesday.Insight would typically survey seniors. The survey of freshers was conducted for the first time by the new editorial board, so there is no historical data to compare. Life before IIT-B was largely about JEE, with 40% spending four to seven hours daily and 30% dedicating between 7 and 12 hours to prepare. Of those who cracked the exam, 21% took a year's drop from school to solely train for the JEE. ""For nearly all our respondents, their own expectations put pressure on them to crack the JEE,"" the survey found. For all the hullabaloo over IIT fees, it is interesting to note that nearly 75% students spent up to Rs 2.5 lakh on JEE coaching. But all that burnt them out and 50% of them, now having entered IIT-B, don't feel like putting effort into academics.Students plan to study for an average of 1.4 hours every day at IIT-B, the study noted. Later, after passing out, 32% expect their first annual salary to be in the range of Rs 10lakh-Rs25 lakh. Then there are those, about 11%, who expect a yearly compensation of more than Rs 60 lakh. And a decade after graduation, while 72% of them would continue to be in engineering some don't have a clue and many others want to be entrepreneurs."

Rajan also praised Madhya Pradesh for achieving maximum growth rate in the country.Rajan met Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan during his two day visit, on Friday. During this short visit, he emphasised that basic financial education should be included in school curricula up to senior secondary level. ""There is a strong need to run campaign for financial education of schoolchildren and farmers,"" he added.If financial experts are to be believed, financial literacy forms a triad, together with financial inclusion and consumer protection, which is necessary for ensuring financial stability. The three also have a strong interplay among each other.The RBI through its brain storming sessions has envisaged a time frame of five years for its massive education campaign across the country. This is based upon the premise that the most effective way is to weave financial education into the normal content of curriculum.Experts are engaging with the curriculum setting bodies like the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), education boards like Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), central and state governments, to try and embed such concepts in the school curriculum, said sources in the RBI.Raising the long pending issues of loans, Rajan said government should help nationalized banks in recovery of debts. He said the RBI will also strengthen banking correspondent system besides, training and certification.Highlighting initiatives taken in rural banking sector, the RBI Governor said after expansion in payment bank and mobile banking system, payment system in rural areas will be improved. He also stressed to improve the working of cooperatives banks and provide infrastructure facilities to micro, small and medium entrepreneurship (MSME) groups.Chief minister Chouhan said that state government ratings should be done on the basis of their financial condition. ``States with good financial position be encouraged'', said Chouhan. He also highlighted state initiatives in the filed of entrepreneurship and efforts to make the income of farmers double in five years.The chief minister also demanded to ensure cash inflow in banks to make payments to the farmers in seven days during procurement of wheat. He also demanded hike in the refinance limit from NABARD to 50% from the current 40% and to streamline statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) in government securities."

"Now, SC hints at allowing state, pvt med exams",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Now-SC-hints-at-allowing-state-pvt-med-exams/articleshow/52048871.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after directing implementation of National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) as a single examination for admission to medical courses and scrapping tests conducted by states and private medical colleges, the Supreme Court on Friday hinted that these tests could be held pending a final decision on their validity.The order has triggered confusion among medical aspirants on whether these tests would finally be held as valid or all admissions done through NEET.The court had on Thursday directed the Centre, CBSE and Medical Council of India to conduct NEET in two phases -including AIPMT as Phase I -but on Friday , the government pleaded the case for states and private colleges to hold separate exams, saying students preparing for tests in regional languages would be disadvantaged. Attorney general Mu kul Rohatgi appeared before a bench headed by Justice AR Dave seeking modification of the April 28 order and was supported by various state governments and private colleges.Justice Dave said the special bench would have to sit to hear the case, which was not possible before May 3.""Several problems have cropped up after Thursday's order. Majority of states have done all preparation for conducting the exams which are scheduled to be held almost on a daily basis. Those exams are to be conducted in vernacular languages and students of those states would not be comfortable to compete through NEET which will be held in Hindi or English. Students are running against time,"" he said.Rohatgi opposed the idea of NEET in two phases and said only one exam should be conducted on July 24, reflecting concerns that students appearing in the first phase scheduled for Sunday will be at a disadvantage.SC's order reviving NEET came at a time when a few tests have already been conducted. NEET, declared illegal and unconstitutional in 2013, was restored on April 11 after a five-judge Constitution bench recalled the earlier verdict and allowed to implement the test.Times ViewThe SC was right in reversing its earlier order so as to allow for a single entrance test to be held for medical college admissions.However, it is perhaps best to institute that system from next year rather than insisting on its immediate implementation. There is already too much uncertainty surrounding the current year's process and candidates should be spared any further anxiety on this count."

The radical move to offer a fast-track B Tech degree as an option to students across courses was taken in a recent senate meeting of the institute. Students who are keen on completing the course faster, can choose to take up additional credits and complete their course in just three and a half years. As of now, none of the older IITs have started offering the fast-track BTech, but, IIT-Kharagpur is moving towards it and plans to implement it from the 2017 batch.""In the final semester, students are free to opt for internships, start work on their entrepreneurial venture or spend a semester abroad at any institute as an exchange student. They will be free to opt for anything. The finer details of the plan are yet to be worked out. The provision is applicable to students from the current batch itself, so they can start accumulating credits from the next academic year,"" said the director of IIT-Bombay, Devang Khakhar. He added that these students, who complete their coursework in three-and-a-half-year, will be eligible to sit for the placements in December and start working immediately too once they are placed. ""Once the students complete their course in three and a half years, they will be asked to leave the campus. Students will be given a provisional statement of marks, but the final degree certificate will be given to the students only during the institute's convocation,"" said Shubham Goyal, external general secretary of academic affairs (undergraduate). The provision is currently applicable only for the BTech students, whether it can be extended to dual degree students will be decided on case-to-case basis, said Goyal.Students can start accumulating additional courses after the completion of the first year. ""They can choose to do any courses that they wish to. For some courses, which will require the student to have completed a pre-requisite course, they will have to choose it after second or third year,"" said Goyal. The system will enable the students to learn at their own pace, without any stress. However, there will be a limit on the campus stay. Though students can take more than six years to complete their BTech programme too, they will not be allowed to stay on the campus beyond that, said a student. Beyond six years, students will have to make alternative arrangements outside the campus. This will also help the institute's administration, which is anyway facing a shortage of accommodation facilities for the ever-increasing strength.While around 15 students from every batch are keen to complete their course and leave the campus, once the system is institutionalised, there will be more takers, said a student. IIT-Kharagpur, is probably the only institute to have moved to a partial flexible credit system. Director Partha Chakrabarti said, ""We are anyway allowing students to take up micro-credits in their final semester. We have already introduced a flexible system to allow students to learn at their own pace. The fast-track B Tech programme will be offered by 2017 as we are bringing about the changes in phases. Sixty per cent of the work is already done and implemented."""

"Engineering courses galore, but India has no data on how many engineers and of what kind",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Engineering-courses-galore-but-India-has-no-data-on-how-many-engineers-and-of-what-kind/articleshow/51961568.cms,"MUMBAI: Are you an electrical engineer or a computer science graduate? If they are often asked this question by confused recruiters, the government is equally unclear about the number and kind of engineers that the nation produces. In a young country where engineering is one of the most preferred professional careers, there is no clarity on the count of students who graduate in each discipline. How many mechanical or electrical engineers do we produce? No one knows. It is the battery of engineering courses with outlandish labels that is to be blamed for the situation. India has 234 degree and 399 diploma courses in engineering. ""All that is being consolidated now. Although it is taking some time, we are working on streamlining the course tags,"" said AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe.  While the problem may seem elementary, this fundamental faux has left India with no statistical information on engineers in the country who have specialised in various disciplines.  The problem, as an AICTE official said on the condition of anonymity, also leads to several handicaps. ""First, there is no historical data. Second, if this is not corrected now, it will be impossible to plan for the future in terms of schematic expansion or even if we need to cut down on growth."" For instance, he added, there is no central agency that maintains data on graduating engineers. And, there is no information on stream-wise breakup of engineers either. Decades ago, an engineering education was the sole domain of the government. In 1980, when the sector opened up, experts felt that the core engineering sectors must be taught by state colleges only, said former All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman S S Mantha. ""But students only queued up for core subjects. So private colleges would change the names of the course a bit and apply for government approval,"" added Mantha. Getting an academic bona fide was simple. The central template of the course from a government college was picked. With a bit of tweaking and rewiring, a new programme was designed around it and renamed. For instance, when the electronics boom started, different courses such as power electronics, electrical communication, electrical and electronics engineering and a whole range of programmes with varied names were offered. What's more, consolidating this list now isn't easy either. ""For instance, is the electrical engineering and computer science more bent towards electronics or computer science?"" asked Mantha.  Experts say the fact that there are 42 degree programmes in electrical engineering and electronics, all with ""outlandish nomenclature"", indicates these have been created for the convenience of private institutes. ""A new college has to start with a minimum student intake of 300, distributed equally among five branches. Different nomenclatures benefit profit-minded institutes that want only popular disciplines,"" said a member of the committee which analysed vacancies in professional courses and suggested remedial measures to Maharashtra government."

CBSE issues advisory to schools to use NCERT textbooks,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/CBSE-issues-advisory-to-schools-to-use-NCERT-textbooks/articleshow/51881970.cms,"CHENNAI: Central Board of Secondary Education has put up an advisory to schools affiliated to it to use the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books for all classes as it has received reports and complaints from parents that they were pressurised by schools to buy an excessive number of textbooks published by others.  Calling prescription of too many books and coercing parents and children to buy the same as unhealthy, the board reiterated that schools needn't look beyond NCERT books as the material forms the base for not only board exams but competitive exams like JEE as well.  Currently, the mechanism is such that while schools need to use only NCERT books for Classes 9 to 12, other publications could be used for Classes up to 8. ""But we are recommending that more schools start using NCERT books for lower classes as well,"" said K Srinivasan, regional officer-CBSE, Chennai, adding that it is only an advisory and not a hard and fast rule.  Schools, on their part, said they had reasons to opt for other publications for lower classes. Ajit Prasad Jain, senior principal, Bhavan's Rajaji Vidyashram, said with the nearest NCERT godown/sale counter being based in Bengaluru, there is nearly a wait of six months to procure books and it is convenient to buy other publications that don't sway away from the prescribed CBSE syllabus.  Chitra, a teacher with Vidya Mandir, said while NCERT books do provide a solid foundation of the syllabus, going for private publication books helps them cover more modules.  ""We prescribe just one book in each subject such that there isn't much pressure on parents as far as expenses are concerned. We ensure that the books we hand pick not only cover the NCERT syllabus, but also helps us walk the extra mile in helping children develop a thorough knowledge of subjects with more modules or explanations as the case maybe,"" she said.  The CBSE said parents and students could avail free NCERT e-books on www.epathshala.nic.in and www.cbse.nic.in."

""There is no uniformity in education across India and it may be unfair to ask students to appear for a common test which will be based on the CBSE syllabus, without giving them adequate time to prepare,"" he said.In addition, the council should also talk to states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh which have been resisting the regulation since it was introduced. Tamil Nadu, for instance, said a common entrance will be a disadvantage to rural students as they would not have access to coaching centres.

The commission also gave time to the school to respond to the remaining complaints ot the parent until the next hearing. The parents have been fighting the case in the commission since a corporal punishment incident in October 2015.The parents have requested the commission to recommend police investigation in harassment case that their son was subjected to in the school. ""We will move the school tribunal and also go for a private complaint against the school after the commission's judgement,"" said the father. The boy already has secured admission in an Airoli school."

Minister of state with independent charge for power, coal, and new and renewable energy Piyush Goel was present at the event. The march led to the inauguration of a youth conference that aimed to create awareness about the importance of securing a permanent place in the UNSC.Over 10,000 people signed a petition regarding the seat which the Indian government is expected to pass on to the UN.Over 7,500 students of class VIII to X from over 150 schools across India participated in the conference. Elaborating on the importance of the conference and the subsequent need for India to become a part of the UNSC, Rishabh Shah, founder, IIMUN said, ""Though over 5,000 Indian soldiers have been serving in the UN in its peace-keeping force, we are still unable to secure our borders. It is thus important for the country to secure a permanent seat at the UNSC.""Elaborating on how they plan to pitch their demand to the UNSC, Shah explained, ""A majority of India's population consists of the youth. And hence, we need to educate young minds on local, national and international issues.We are scheduled to host such conferences across 108 cities in India to garner more student petitions and support."" The organisation has also scheduled a model conference in the premises of the UN headquarters, New York, on August 15 this year. Over 400 Indian students are expected to participate in the conference."
CBSE asks schools to keep student bags light,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/CBSE-asks-schools-to-keep-student-bags-light/articleshow/51911361.cms,"NEW DELHI: Aiming to keep bags of school children light, CBSE has suggested that teachers should discourage senior students from carrying heavy reference books while schools may continue to keep books of kids up to class II in the school.In a notification issued by it, CBSE has come up with various recommendations, including the suggestion that school heads and teachers should ensure that senior students bring books according to the time table, and discourage them from carrying heavy 'reference' books or other such materials to school.It has also said it should be ensured that the school curriculum supports more activity-based, ICT-supported learning for all the main subjects in all classes, as far as possible.Homework is to be 'staggered' to prevent overload and academic co-ordinators or supervisors may monitor this, is another suggestion offered by CBSE.Schools have also been asked to explore the possibility of block scheduling of subject classes in the class time table.Co-curricular activities should be conducted every day, and scheduled in the time table accordingly, to ensure the balance of bag weight throughout the academic session, the CBSE has said.School heads should counsel parents and teachers about developmental issues caused by children carrying heavy bags to school, according to it.Among other suggestions is restriction of number of textbooks to the prescribed norms [NCERT], particularly at the primary and upper primary levels.It has also been recommended that books should not be covered with non-biodegradable plastic sheet.Another suggestion is that schools may continue the practice of maintaining and keeping books of students up to class II in the school.Schools may provide racks with locks in all classrooms, where reference books, sports equipment, uniforms can be safely stored without needing to be carried to school, is another suggestion.Setting up of class libraries and asking students to carry well-designed backpacks correctly, to promote good posture, are among other recommendations."

Our courses are same in quality as offline courses: Zvi Galil,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Our-courses-are-same-in-quality-as-offline-courses-Zvi-Galil/articleshow/51823505.cms,"Computer science graduates are in high demand and this demand is only set to grow in the United States and elsewhere, Zvi Galil, dean of College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology tells ET in an interview. Bennett University and Georgia Institute of Technology are in discussions to facilitate delivery of the US university's online MS in Computer Science (OMS CS) program to greater numbers of Indian students. Under a proposed agreement, Bennett would provide local, on-the-ground testing and academic support for the program, which has grown from inception to thousands of enrolled students in just two years.What is this course and how will it be different from other online courses? Online courses have existed since the advent of the Internet the 1990s, however, Georgia Tech's program is the first to offer an advanced degree from a top US university for a fraction of the typical cost. Many on-campus students at Georgia Tech pay nearly $45,000 for the same degree, while the total cost of OMS CS is under $7,000. OMS CS is pedagogically different from regular distance-learning courses, where classes typically are simply recorded and uploaded for student viewing. In the Georgia Tech program, courses more resemble highly produced movies, with quizzes and other assessments offered at close intervals throughout the lessons. The program produced its first graduates in December 2015, and those students received diplomas identical to their on-campus counterparts.How many students are you looking to have from India?OMS CS launched in 2014 with 380 students, and it has quickly grown to more than 3,350 students from all over the world. Of these, India's makes up for nearly 10 percent, which could easily grow to 20 to 30 percent in the coming years.What are the hot jobs in this space? Computers are everywhere; even engineers need computers. Therefore, there is a huge requirement of jobs in the United States for computer science graduates. The number of jobs in computer science are far greater than the number graduates available which is the reverse trend from engineering jobs. Similarly, in social science, there are a huge number of graduates but not enough jobs. I believe this is also the trend in India. It's not coding jobs but also systems engineers; software engineers; jobs in machine learning and data analytics are popular. Data analytics around machine learning, which is a very difficult field, also has a lot of jobs."
Varied paths,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Varied-paths/articleshow/51972792.cms,"Humanities and social sciences have emerged as a diverse stream leading to wide-ranging careersThe humanities or social sci ences primarily include sub jects such as literature, sociology, psychology, political science, history, as well as other fields like journalism, media studies and communications, social work and gender studies. Today, being an arts student is not like what it was a decade ago. ""Humanities offer a plethora of career options in publishing houses, the media, content editing, advertising, NGOs, as well as in research work and the film industry. The social sciences offer varied perspectives and opportunities to hone one's skills,"" says Kavya Benny, a student of English (honours) at St Stephen's College, Delhi.""Publishing in academicgeneral publishing firms is, of course, a popular avenue. Students pursuing an MA in subjects such as English, economics, political science or communication studies, go into MNCs, HR, training and R&D;, as well as content and technical writing. Some pursue an MBA later. Others opt for language training for specific professions at various levels. With the possibility of freelance and consultation work, there is no need now for humanities students to become only teachers, unless one wants to,"" says Anna Kurian, associate professor, Department of English, University of Hyderabad.A changing trendApart from traditional careers, like teaching or the civil services, students are opting for careers such as corporate law, jobs with banks and other financial institutions, hotel and tourism services, etc. ""The wider scope of jobs, which have expanded or emerged in these areas, has given humanities students an edge in varied professions,"" says Pranab Kumar Das, associate professor of economics, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata. ""The services sector -particularly banking, insurance, tourism and hotels and hospitality -has grown the fastest in recent times. The computer software industry, too, promises good job prospects.There is scope for jobs in marketing and other services that humanities students can look at,"" he adds.Recent trends show that career prospects after an arts degree de pend on the type of course completed, the most common being English, economics, comparative literature, international relations, and marketing communications, etc.Here's a look at varied options:Media (print and broadcast): It is still seen as a viable career and the percentage of students looking at media studies and journalism has not decreased. The option lies not just in newspapers but also in digital media.Students with a degree in media studies, journalism and communication can look at joining media houses as trainees or directly as copy editors or reporters. With time and experience, they can rise up the ranks.Public relations: This is a growing field, which requires strong reading, writing and interpersonal skills. This, when combined with an inherent understanding of the client, leads to the creation of a public image.Corporate houses hiring PR professionals range from companies deal ing with hardcore technical aspects such as power and steel, to real estate, healthcare, communications, as well as technology-specific companies such as Google.Event management: One can hold a degree in any field of the humanities or social sciences. However, with good knowledge of how to plan and organise an event, it can be easy to make people and companies happy. A diploma is not essential as it is the people skills as well as logistics that need to be perfect. There are many employment opportunities in event management companies, which work for corporates across sectors.Interpreter andor translator: If you have learnt a second language, you can become an interpreter or a translator. ""These professionals translate a foreign language into English (or maybe an Indian language) or vice versa. Interpreters specialise in spoken or signed language, while translators work primarily with written material,"" says an official of Goethe Institute in Kolkata. Translatorsinterpreters are in demand in government agencies, universities, MNCs, chambers of commerce, firms con ducting market surveys, the film industry, and of course, medical transcription, among other ar eas. Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, German and Russian are the sought-after languages.Advertising industry: Some humanities majors such as English and regional languages, as well as comparative literature, are wellsuited for creative work in the ad industry. From the same industry, some take to advertising sales positions that require excellent communication skills and the prowess to persuade.Contenttechnical writing: The subject matter may seem a little dry to some -without the thrill or creativity of producing news or features -but the work helps one to hone their writing abilities. Though purely technical, the content is important and the final product one makes of it. The IT sector is the main employer. Often, logistics companies, too, engage content writers.Counselling: An undergraduate arts degree is the starting point for somebody who wants to be a counsellor. Most counselling positions, however, require completion of a Master's degree in psychology.Jobs are in organisations including schools, hospitals, clinics, industrial firms, corporate offices, etc.Museums (workercurator): With some experience and a Master's degree in museum studies as well as education, you can work your way up to become a curator and manage the museum's collections and activities.Human resources: It's all about dealing with people and understanding their needs and problems.HR specialists are integral to the interviewing and hiring process. Humanities graduates can pursue a management degree in HR to work in this field.Psephology: Arts graduates, mainly in political science, international relations, economics and history, can look for employment in research organisations, TV channels, newspapers, market research and parliament, etc, using their expertise in analysing election trends.LinguisticsA linguist is an expert in language.Linguists are concerned with language variation according to social settings (socio-linguistics), geographical regions (dialectology), time periods (historical linguistics), relationship between language and mind (psycholinguistics) and many such topics. They work in government, academia (educational institutions), publishing, the media, computer languages, voice analysis research, etc. In recent years, there has been a surge in the demand for these professionals in various industries. This is due to developments in artificial intelligence, communication sciences, and computer applications in natural language processing and understanding, information sciences and other high-technology activities. There are also developing fields in bilingualism, literacy, linguistic problems of ethnic minorities, and other topics in applied linguistics"
Rejig teacher education body: Panel report,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Rejig-teacher-education-body-Panel-report/articleshow/51961466.cms,"New Delhi : A high-level committee has recommended overhaul of National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) and setting up of at least two teacher education universities in each state, besides bringing down the number of programmes for them to three. The committee's report has recommended National-level Entrance Examination for Teacher Education (NEETE), to be conducted by NCTE, for admission to teacher education programmes. It is suggested that only candidates with more than 50% marks be considered for admission. The report said top ranking 2,000 candidates should be given a stipend of Rs 5,000 per month by the central government. Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) conducted by CBSE, the report says, should be enlarged to include Secondary Teacher Eligibility Test (STET). ""None of the other regulatory bodies in the country is in such a pathetic condition,"" the report said.The committee, headed by former NCTE chairperson Mohd Akhtar Siddiqui, has also recommended that regional committees (RCs) be disbanded and converted into Teacher Education Resources Centres (TERCs). Though this report has been silent, previous reports by the HRD ministry have found the RCs to be a hotbed of corruption.Pointing out that some of the regulations of 2014 are neither pragmatic nor operationally feasible, the committee said considering the paucity of people with Ph D in education, it is not wise to insist on having professors in the faculty. The panel has also said that nomenclatures of teacher education programmes be reduced to three, namely Diploma in Education (D Ed), Bachelor of Education (B Ed) and Master of Education (M.Ed).  Several specific branches opted by students can be given in parentheses. The report also pointed out that a two-year M Ed course is being resisted.  Therefore, viable option would be to have two-year B Ed and one year M Ed with elongated academic year of 230 working days."
"Mission admission: Words count, breaking the language barrier",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Mission-admission-Words-count-breaking-the-language-barrier/articleshow/51876877.cms,"It's that time of the year again, when students have to make choices that will define their careers. To have many choices is wonderful but when the options are many, and all appear compelling, making an informed decision is a challenge. TOI's 'Mission Admission' guides students through the season. Today's focus: Foreign LanguagesBonjour, Hola or Ciao, the words of a foreign language never cease to amuse us. From comics to films, fairy tales to signboards, we have always picked up a few words of a different tongue. And the tiny vocabulary has been helpful during our vacations abroad and our interactions with exchange students. But knowing a foreign language can also land you a job in a multinational company (MNC) or an embassy. While French and German have seen many takers over the years, experts say East Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean are fast catching up as international firms set up base in India. ""The demand for East Asian languages has grown with automobile companies like Hyundai, entering the market,"" says Nandini Menon, manager, teaching and information, InKo Centre.With Manga comics, graphic novels, K-pop and K-drama making their way to bookshelves and television screens, youngsters these days are keen on learning Korean and Japanese too. Learning these pictorial scripts might be tedious but their novelty keeps students engaged.One is often in a dilemma on which language to learn. French, German and Spanish have been all-time favourites as they pave the way for an education in Europe. And with more Indian companies having European clients, the demand is only growing. ""Before applying for a course, students usually understand the relationship India shares with that particular country, which eventually decides the job and educational possibilities,"" says Neerja Samajdar, associate professor, Centre for Korean Studies (SLL &CS;), JNU. ""After the European languages, the Asian dialects are the most popular courses among applicants."" While languages like Arabic are also offered in most universities, experts say that they are usually popular among students who are familiar with a similar tongue like Urdu.Knowing a foreign language can open doors to otherwise inaccessible avenues. For consulting professional Swanamukhi, learning French is making a huge difference. ""Since my job involves assisting foreign companies, I was dealing with many French clients,"" says Swarnamukhi. ""Initially, I didn't know the language but after I started learning it, I am able to interact with them. It has also helped in networking.""A plethora of career options have mushroomed over the years in the industry. Apart from MNCs, culture and tourism sectors have always harboured a demand for foreign language professionals. ""Translation and interpretation jobs are the most sought after in agencies and corporates. Freelancing is a lucrative option but the uncertainty of assignments can make it risky,"" says Akhila Phadnis, freelance French translator.Being known as the medical hub of the world, India has many foreign patients visiting the country for treatment. And many translation agencies act as bridges between the expat community and doctors. ""For instance, some firms specialise in translating medical prescriptions and legal documents for Japanese families settled here,"" says Chellappa Sriram, vice president, ABK AOTS DOSOKAI, a city-based Japanese training centre.International summits and meets organised by institutions like the United Nations and European Union serve as ideal career lauchpads for language experts."

Other projects included ways to treat waste.The Braille books can help the visually challenged understand diagrams, maps and shapes in textbooks.The textbooks include tactile graphics which are supposed to provide access to non-visual representations of diagrams and figures in subjects such as maths, sci ence, economic and geography, which have been a challenge for persons with visual impairment. The model has been developed by Centre of Excellence in Tactile Graphics (Co ETG), set up to em power persons with visual im pairment by pro viding such diagrams in high-quality tactile form at a low cost. With a team of designers, engineers and technicians have created diagrams which would be available for Rs 15 per sheet.""The class IX Braille study material with tactile diagrams in six volumes has been produced by the centre and is being tested in schools,"" informed M Balakrishnan, professor, department of computer sci ence and engineering.There was is a need for such projects as almost 50% of the physically challenged in India are visually challenged, said Balakrishnan, who is in charge of several projects related to the visually challenged, including the Braille display.Tactile graphics are images that consist of raised lines and textures produced using embossing, thermoforming or other technologies on a physical medium like PVC sheets or Braille paper so that people with visual impairment could perceive images by touching. Tactile graphics could be produced in many ways, but embossing, thermoforming and swell paperbased options are the most popular, said Balakrishnan.Embossing for tactile graphics involves using a special Braille printer to emboss a diagram on normal Braille paper.Others showcased bamboo structures as a sustainable alternative to cementand-steel columns.The projects were aimed at solving problems of the masses. V Ramgopal Rao, institute director, said, ""The exhibition provides an opportunity for the public to see our students' work.""The institute has been organising open houses for 12 years. Some projects make it beyond the prototype stage and become products. Professors said they were trying to involve more students in research projects."

"Teaching dance as art, not just shaking a leg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Teaching-dance-as-art-not-just-shaking-a-leg/articleshow/51926312.cms,"Schools need to have certification, refresher courses""Sir, I want to leave my job at the bank to learn Bharatanatyam in Tamil Nadu,"" says a 30-year-old Keralite living in Bangalore who is a mother of a one-year-old. To compound the situation for me, she says her husband wishes to quit his job too, to work full-time in theatre. Two decades ago this would have been unheard of, but not today.Learning music or dance has now taken centre-stage. Just 50 years ago, women performing in public were looked down upon. Since then we have had pioneers like Rukmini Devi and Vallathol building institutions like Kalakshetra and Kalamandalam. Today the situation is different. Come summer, children are sent to art and music classes that crop up in every locality. So the popularity would be good news for the fraternity. Unfortunately it is not so. The mushrooming schools of art, dance and music may seem to nurture the creative aspirations of students, but rarely do they meet the yardstick in terms of style, knowledge and aesthetics. Also the values behind learning are often misplaced.Why have dance and music become important? A few decades ago, it was important because it gave an understanding of culture and mythology. This idea has got diluted over the years. Till a few years ago, performance on stage meant being socially visible and competing with film stars. Today it is all about making a career. Most youngsters know they can earn a livelihood, if not by performing, then by teaching.But not everyone who learns dance can become a star dancer, singer, or an actor. Neither is it guaranteed that they will be good teachers unless they put in the required dedication and research. Here comes the role of parents who think learning an art form for a few years is enough for their ward to be the next big thing on stage. They forget that those who have made it big on stage -the Dhananjayans, Padma Subrahmanyam, Malavika Sarukkai and Bombay Jayashri or Aruna Sairam -have at least 20 to 40 years of work behind them. For them their art was a complete engagement, sometimes at the cost of family.Here comes the question of what the dance instructors are teaching. The other day I was asked the meaning of 'alarippu' by a young girl. I explained how it energises the body and awakens chakras (energy vortices) if done properly, and how once so charged, the body has the stamina to perform for long, effortlessly.She then asked me ""Sir what's a chakra? I thought it meant going in circles in Kathak."" Her questions reminded me of another time a foreigner asked me, almost philosophically, ""Last time I was in India there was this form called Kathak. When did they add 'ali' to it to make it Kathakali?"" So, when a student of dance asks such questions, is it the student or the teacher who is at fault?It's time we re-examined the way we learn and teach the arts. Firstly, the arts cannot be seen in isolation. There has to be a thorough study of literature, music and aharya to gain full knowledge about dance. This approach to learning is taken up only in established institutions and by senior gurus who teach the A, B, C of dance -Aharya or the costume, Baani or style, and Chitra or documented heritage.National agencies like the Sangeet Natak Akademi ought to make certification of schools teaching dance or music stricter by conducting inspections before giving grants. Teacher training programmes with refresher courses need to be introduced and practised well. Once every five years, the CCRT (Centre for Cultural Resources and Training) should evaluate and conduct training. In this regard a 'goshti' (council of senior gurus) can also be the conscience keeper of standards and annually visit teaching institutions to assess, guide and advice. The idea is to inculcate reverence and focus on the arts, and not treat it like a hobby or career devoid of any passion for it. Only then can we bring back meaning and soul to every performance.(The author is a dance critic-historian. He also edits the yearbook 'attenDance')"

Moving to other initiatives of the HRD ministry, Irani said that rather than monitoring the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), the programme for achievement of universalisation of elementary education, annually as was done during the UPA, her ministry would track it online daily.""We did mid term review online.

It said the ""majority verdict"" delivered by then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir did not consider an earlier SC judgment that was binding on the bench, nor had he consulted other members of his bench.Justice Dave, who was part of the bench headed by Justice Kabir, had dissented strongly, complaining that he was not consulted, possibly because of paucity of time as the then CJI had delivered the verdict a day before his retirement. Justice Dave had then ruled in favour of NEET, but Justices Kabir and Vikramjit Sen quashed the test.Monday's decision is seen as a shot in the arm for efforts to weed out malpractices in admissions, such as capitation fees and discretionary criteria, used by private colleges to indulge in profiteering by circumventing a merit-based selection system for allotment of MBBS, BDS and PG seats.Lakhs of students appear for medical entrance examinations for admission to more than 400 colleges every year to compete for more than 52,000 MBBS seats. Since 2013, state governments and private colleges have conducted separate examinations for these.Monday's order leaves Medical Council of India with the onerous task of conducting the NEET at a short notice as students have already filled out forms for several entrance tests. Immediately after judgment reviving the NEET was pronounced in open court the recalling the previous order, stunned lawyers, appearing for private colleges, pleaded that the SC clarify the consequences.The bench replied that ""natural consequence"" was that NEET comes into force. It said the court would give a fresh hearing on constitutional validity of NEET but in the meantime, the exam will be restored. The lawyers then pleaded that the MCI's notification to bring NEET back be stayed till its validity was decided afresh and said that in 2013, too, an interim stay was given. The bench, however, rejected the plea saying the interim order was only for one academic session and it could not continue. ""After giving our thoughtful and due consideration, we are of the view that the judgment delivered in Christian Medical College needs reconsideration,"" the bench said."
Children of illegal immigrants blocked from enrolling in US schools: Report,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Children-of-illegal-immigrants-blocked-from-enrolling-in-US-schools-Report/articleshow/51780789.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Immigrant children living in US without legal status have been blocked from registering for school and accessing the educational services they need, according to a report on school districts in four states by Georgetown University Law Center researchers.Such students have faced long enrollment delays and have been turned away from classrooms as the result of some districts' arbitrary interpretations of residency rules and state laws, the researchers said.All children including those living in the US illegally must attend school through at least the 8th grade or until they turn 16 under compulsory education laws in all 50 states. Many states allow students to enroll beyond that age, according to the Education Commission of the States.But some districts' elaborate paperwork requirements effectively have kept immigrant youth out of school, while lack of translation and interpretation services have left their families uninformed about the process, the report found.The Obama administration's efforts to find and deport the tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American children and families who arrived during the 2014 surge of illegal crossings have further complicated the situation, prompting some students to avoid school for fear that they will be picked up by authorities, the report's authors said.""US law is clear on this point no child in the United States should be excluded from public education,"" said Mikaela Harris, a Georgetown law student who co-wrote the study issued by the university's Human Rights Institute and the nonprofit Women's Refugee Commission. ""That doesn't always play out in practice.""In May 2014, then-Education Secretary Arne Duncan issued joint guidance with the Justice Department reminding districts that a 1982 Supreme Court ruling gives all children the right to enroll in school, regardless of immigration status.The report, which studied school districts in Florida, New York, Texas and North Carolina, calls for a strengthening of federal outreach to districts unaccustomed to serving newcomer populations and better assurances that educational access continues amid immigration enforcement. Researchers said they had presented their recommendations to the Department of Education.""We remain vigilant about our responsibility to protect the civil rights of all students, including immigrant students, undocumented students and unaccompanied immigrant students,"" Education Department spokeswoman Dorie Nolt said. ""We have provided a number of resources to communities in order to do so.""The agency is committed to working with federal agencies and community organizations to address any issues, she added.US Immigration Customs and Enforcement spokesman Bryan Cox said he had not seen the report so could not comment on it, but said agency policy in general precludes any enforcement activity at schools and other sensitive locations."

This led to protest by outstation students resulting in clashes.The situation inside the campus has been volatile since then and the authorities have posted paramilitary personnel. The local police was manning the main gate of the institute.Expressing a sense of insecurity in the campus, a group of outstation students have left the institute after the HRD ministry gave them an option of appearing for the exams later.The HRD Ministry had sent a three-member team to campus last week to take stock of the situation and held talks with the agitating students to defuse the tension. The team is camping in Srinagar till the ongoing exams are over.A group of students from NIT, Sringar, had protested at Jantar Mantar in the national capital earlier this week. The student delegation, accompanied by members of ABVP, had also met Smriti Irani and demanded shifting of the campus out of Srinagar which she had outrightly rejected."

Delhi govt launches mentor teacher programme,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Delhi-govt-launches-mentor-teacher-programme/articleshow/51729136.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Government is making help available to teachers struggling to deliver lessons in its schools. From 1,100 applicants, the Directorate of Education has selected 200 teachers who will serve as ""mentor teachers"" for their colleagues in other schools. Education minister, Manish Sisodia launched the programme on Thursday. This programme, the first round will last two years, is open to guest teachers as well.The selection process was rigourous. The initial circular had asked interested candidates to describe any innovative method they have deployed in class. Jyoti Lakra had used a ""speaking pen"" -- it would read whatever text it's touched with -- in class to get students at her Mundka school interested in learning English. Lakra had found it at a scrap-dealer's and then shelled out for a new one. ""Usually our students are very weak in English. But using this made significant difference to the 'assessment of speaking and listerning' component of the curriculum,"" she says. She'll be one of the mentors.""We need a network of committed people who can change the system for the better. And also, other teachers will be more willing to listen to you than us (bureacrats) because you are from the same system and handle the same issues,"" says Punya Salila Srivastava, secretary, education. However, Sisodia gave them an out. ""You can withdraw now if you can't commit for the next two years,"" he says. Srivastava adds that the contribution of those who do sign up, will have to be significant enough to ""justify depriving the hundreds of kids whose lives they impact in their classes."" In the immediate future, the selected teachers who do choose to continue will undergo training in two rounds. Over April and May, there will be a two-day orientation programme followed by a 15-day training programme including both theory and practice sessions and, finally, a residential ""Jeevan Vidya Shivir"" at Hapur for team-building. ""July-onwards, the mentors will start on on-site support and monitoring of classroom practice. Each teacher will be assigned five-six schools s/he will have to regularly visit and meet,"" says Atishi Marlena, advisor to the Sisodia.Mentor teachers had queries about service conditions. One asked if guest teachers will have the same role as their 'regular' counterparts; another asked if they'll be given transport or have access to resources such as computers and, in one case, ""benefits."" The new education director, Saumya Gupta explained that at least this government does not think ""only the top-level bureaucrats and ministers can be motivated by things other than money.

Learning enrichment programme expanded to Classes VI to IX in all schools,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Learning-enrichment-programme-expanded-to-Classes-VI-to-IX-in-all-schools/articleshow/51730078.cms,"NEW DELHI: Learning from experience last year, the Directorate of Education's Project Pragati is being revised and expanded. 'Piloted' only for the last batch of ninth-graders, this year it will cover all grades six to nine at all Delhi Government schools, five ""core"" subjects and roughly impact nine lakh students.Intervention at ninth grade, that too in just three subjects, came a little too late, feel department officials. This time, they're starting early. The course material -- put together by the department's teachers with support from the NGO, Pratham, and printed by the Delhi Bureau to Textbooks -- was ready by February and about 24,000 teachers who teach classes VI to X were ""oriented"" over five days ending on April 7. The programme itself will continue till the summer vacations start.Crucially, the ""supplementary material"" being put together by the department is largely in Hindi with some expressions rendered in English. While DoE officials concede there is high demand for English-medium teaching now, instruction in the vernacular is a requirement of the Right to Education Act, 2009. There is also a sizeable body of research -- including a relatively recent one based on Young Lives longitudinal study conducted in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana -- that says kids learn better when taught in the mother tongue and their capacity to pick up a second language improves significantly too.The plan to divide classes into segments according to the students' learning levels, 'piloted' only at the 54 model schools last year, has been shelved altogether. Shailendra Kumar Sharma, originally from Pratham and now advising the director, education, says the ""supplementary material"" -- in the shape of thin workbooks or booklets -- is appropriate for the diversity in a government school classroom. ""We're not touching the syllabus. There are new stories in the material and worksheets. Many activities are suggested. Some the students can complete independently, some have to be attempted in groups with teachers facilitating. This will help with peer-learning,"" he explains. Anil Teotia, principal of the District Institute for Education and Training (DIET), Dilshad Garden, adds that the enrichment programme will ensure that students start on the year's syllabus with their concepts clear. ""For instance, for Class VI, we'll cover Class V."" This will be followed by a ""dip-stick"" survey to check the progress made.Other adjustments have been made to accommodate this. Teachers have been largely relieved of non-academic work, they have to set only monthly targets and not weekly. The last time they ran the programme, the department centrally sent questions to parents through SMSes to engage them into the process. ""Fathers surprised their children by putting questions to them,"" says Sharma, ""We gathered feedback after it ended - 95% parents said they would love to receive questions on text messages and 70% found their kids studying more."""

Govt to fund scholars for post-doc research in India,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Govt-to-fund-scholars-for-post-doc-research-in-India/articleshow/51583941.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to prevent brain drain, the government has embarked upon a scheme to fund pure science scholars, who have completed their PhDs, to enable them continue their post-doctoral research in India.According to Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, the scholars would be paid Rs 50,000 per month for the period of three years and would also be given a basic grant of Rs 7 lakhs per year for conducting research.The National Post Doctoral Fellowship was launched a month ago and would fund around 1000 scholars this year. Applications have also been invited for the same, he said.""We have found that the scholars are more vulnerable to go abroad after their PhD degree because this is the time they don't get full-time employment since many institutes ask for a post-doctoral degree. There are many universities and institutes abroad that offer the PhDs graduates with post-doctoral opportunities. This is why we have embarked upon this scheme,"" Sharma said.""Once they get a post-doctoral fellowship in India for three-years, they can continue with their research and get prepared for a job in Indian institutes and universities. Once they bag a job, the chances of their going abroad is less,"" he said.Incidentally, the Ministry of Science and Technology does not have a data of how many research scholars have left India and are currently working abroad.""There are two reasons behind it. It is difficult to track the students who leave India for studies at different levels (say, under-graduate, graduate and post-graduate). More importantly, there is also no tracking of students coming back.""Secondly, neither the Ministry of Home Affairs or the Ministry of External Affairs have maintained data related to this,"" said a senior ministry official.Sharma said for bagging this fellowship the scholar has to send a research proposal. It is also mandatory that the university/ institute in which he wants to do research has to accept the proposal."
Here's how kids who fail CET enter govt med schools,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Heres-how-kids-who-fail-CET-enter-govt-med-schools/articleshow/51721872.cms,"Didn't get admission in to the best government medical college in your state? Not even the bottom-rung ones? Don't worry. Your best bet may be to buy a seat in the worst private medical college in the state and pray it doesn't get permission to admit students in the coming years. If that happens, you can go to court and the state government may be ordered to accommodate you in the very colleges you could not get into.That may sound like a bizarre strategy, but it is exactly what has been happening in many states. Several private colleges have failed to get permission to admit students after the first, second or third batch. Then the regular pattern of petitioning courts and getting accommodated in government colleges plays out.An analysis of data on student intake allowed per college, available from 2011, showed that around 42 colleges across the country, almost all private, were barred from admitting students for a year or more in this period, in some cases since the first batch was taken in.How can a medical colle ge given permission, and allowed to admit students one year, be found deficient subsequently and barred from intake? This is because the Medical Council of India (MCI) allows any trust, society or company to start a medical college, even if it doesn't have the required infrastructure and faculty. Medical Council of India rules need a new medical college to show it has good enough infrastructure for first year MBBS students' requirements and an undertaking that the rest will be put in place.MCI assessors inspect a new college every year for five years and issue permission for each year. When they fail to stick to their commitments, the regulator cracks down and doesn't allow further intake. This often works to the advantage of students, although after a legal battle.""College managements constantly hustle the authorities to give them permission to start taking in students even when there is almost no infrastructure. With political connections (most trusts are either run by politicians or their family members), they manage to get permission,"" said a medical college professor.Every year, MCI decides that several colleges, which had received conditional approval and admitted students, are ""not approved permitted for intake"" as the institutions do not have infrastructure. Following this, dozens of cases are filed in high courts and the Supreme Court by the management of these colleges and by students or their parents. In 2015, 27 colleges with 3,650 seats were not allowed to admit students.Of the 10 private medical colleges started in 2014, six (accounting for 900 seats) were not allowed to admit students in 2015. So, what happens to the 900 students admitted in 2014 after paying lakhs as capitation fee?""When denied permission, college managements tell students and their parents to go to court and seek relief if they don't want their investment not to go waste,"" explained a lawyer."

India calls for empowerment of autistic people,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/India-calls-for-empowerment-of-autistic-people/articleshow/51658734.cms,"UNITED NATIONS: Stressing on empowering autistic people through appropriate education and employment opportunities, India has called for enhancing quality of life of differently-abled children.""Autism knows no gender, race, or socio-economic status. Notwithstanding the disorder, people with Autism have a wide range of diverse and unique abilities and often exceptional skills, that can immensely benefit society,"" India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said here on Friday.Addressing a high-level event on 'World Autism Awareness Day', he said the underlying message for attaining sustainable development is that no one must be left behind.""The challenge is to identify early and make every differently-abled children not only count but also capable. These issues need specialized and nuanced attention,"" he said.Akbaruddin emphasised that the main objective of collective efforts should be to ""enhance the quality of life and functional independence and work towards a more inclusive approach"" and families and educational institutions as the main resources for treatment.He cited prime minister Narendra Modi, who has called for collective efforts to ""create a world where persons with disabilities can scale new heights of success without any obstacles.""""The transformative 2030 Agenda provides an opportunity for the full realization of the potential of people with Autism and other developmental disabilities and ensure for them 'a life of dignity and meaning',"" Akbaruddin said.In his message on World Autism the Day, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that autism is not well-understood in many countries, and too many societies shun people with autism.""This is a violation of human rights and a waste of human potential,"" he said.Earlier this year, Moon engaged in a dialogue with a young man with autism at United Nations headquarters. His innovative approach to the implementation of the SDGs was impressive, he said.Noting that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Moon called on societies to invest more funds in enabling young persons with autism to be part of their generation's historic push for progress.A dedicated National Trust for Welfare of Persons with Autism is implementing several schemes for creation of an enabling environment for independent living for people with Autism and disabilities, as much as possible, Akbauruddin said.""The focus is on training, awareness and capacity building, shelter, care giving and empowerment,"" he said.The International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) in India has developed screening and diagnostic tools and research studies on Autism are also being encouraged, he added."

It was not easy to secure an engineering or medical degree, he said.As far as quality and standard of education across the world was concerned, India ranked below 100th among 150 countries, he said quoting a 2010 UNESCO survey.Considering the standard as well as the poor intake, the Medical Council of India had downsized the number of seats by 4,000, he said, adding that over one lakh seats had fallen vacant in engineering seats just a year ago.Moreover, the Gross Enrolment Ratio in India was as low as 20 to 21 per cent compared to 70 per cent in developed nations, he said and urged the youth to not only concentrate on themselves and their families, but take efforts to bring in changes in society, plagued by corruption, tax evasion and black money.About 2,138 graduates from three colleges, part of Sri Krishna Institutions, received degree certificates and 79 rank holders were honored by Vishwanathan."
Making students repeat all exams for failing in one paper unreasonable: Kerala HC,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Making-students-repeat-all-exams-for-failing-in-one-paper-unreasonable-Kerala-HC/articleshow/51636202.cms,"KOCHI: Making students who fail in one theory or practical exam to reappear for all the examinations once again is unreasonable and arbitrary, the Kerala high court said on Thursday. Such practice would only result in unfairness to the extreme and doesn't help in achieving higher quality, the court said.Medical and engineering students having to give up their hopes of obtaining a graduation, or losing multiple years in pursuit of the dream, has become a common scene across the state owing to the insistence of universities that students should reappear for all the examinations if they fail in one of the exams.The practice was sharply criticized by Justice V Chitambaresh after considering a total of 11 petitions filed by post-graduate medical students, Geethu S and others, questioning the insistence of Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS). The students had challenged a clause in KUHS Regulations that stipulated that the students must write all the examinations once again if they fail in one of the examinations or practicals.Through the petitions, the students had also pointed out that while KUHS Regulations requires a student to achieve a minimum of 50 per cent marks in total and a separate minimum of 40 per cent in each examination, Medical Council of India (MCI) Regulations require them to achieve 50 per cent marks in total and doesn't specify a separate minimum for each paper. Thus, KUHS Regulations is contrary to MCI Regulations, the petitioners had contended.The court said in the judgment, ""Repetitive undertaking of examinations after having secured the minimum prescribed does not scale up the standard and can only be termed as oppressive from the point of view of the student. The repetitive appearance in examinations under the KUHS Regulations has no rationale nexus with the object sought to be achieved and is obviously violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India (equality before law).""""The mental anguish which a student has to face in the event of his losing a theory or practical by marginal marks necessitating reappearance for all the papers in theory and practical in order to secure a pass is unimaginable. It is possible that a candidate who has passed in the first attempt may fail in the same examination in the second attempt and the vicious circle of pass and fail will only result in unfairness to the extreme. Clause 3.16 of the KUHS Regulations to the extent it insists that 'a candidate who fails in one subject either theory/practical shall have to appear for all the papers including theory and practical' is unreasonable and arbitrary,"" the court further said.Disposing the petitions, by ruling that KUHS Regulations is not valid as it was not notified in the gazette when the university statue (KUHS First Statutes, 2013) came into being, the court directed MCI to clarify whether the students should simultaneously pass in all papers and asked MCI to advise the university within four months so that it can be incorporated into the KUHS Regulations."

A one-of-its kind course, MPP aims to equip students with skills in framing policies and preparing action plans for various projects for governments and private companies. Of the 42 students, 11 are placed in different companies with a salary package ranging from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 11 lakh per annum. Four have been offered a package of Rs 11 lakh per annum. Four students in the pilot batch have opted out of placements to pursue higher studies.

RCC sends invitation to firms along with relevant information for campus interviews.Multidisciplinary courseThere are 17 National Law Universities (NLU) in the country and only the Bengaluru centre offers MPP. At present, there are hardly any employees specialized in preparing policies, forcing most companies to hire a team of MBA, law and statistics graduates to get the job done.

The course is not restricted to one particular stream of undergraduates; UG students from any stream can pursue it. In the first batch, 46% of the students are from social science and humanities, engineering (28%), commerce and management (14%), Science (5%) and law (5%) and medicine 2%).

Starting this academic session, the AICTE will allow up to 10 students — instead of just two — from the region to study at an institute outside the state.  The move is aimed at ensuring that students do not feel ""isolated"" on a faroff campus. The AICTE is cautious that the upper ceiling must be 10 so that there is no ""bunching"" of students, or ""incidents"" like the cricket-cheering controversy at a Meerut institute in 2014. ""As of now, there are two seats per college or institute under the scholarship scheme. As agreed by the interministerial committee, from this year we will allow 10 J&K; students on scholarship in the same institute. Students will then not feel isolated and have a support system when ill or when travelling back home,"" AICTE chairman Prof Anil Sahasrabudhe told ET.  ""Also, we will not exceed the ceiling of 10 as we do not want any bunching of students since they could lead to certain incidents as seen in reports of an institute earlier,"" the chairman said.  As per the 'bunching' norms, only two students per institute are awarded this scholarship to ""avoid bunching in any one particular institute and to have an even distribution of students among various institutes of the country"".  The ceiling was reviewed in a meeting of the inter-ministerial committee in November 2015. In the last academic year, about 1,600 of the 5,000 available scholarships were taken.  The panel decided there should be a ""supernumerary quota of two seats in all universities/colleges/institutes, for all courses, for students hailing from J&K;"" and ""the limit of two supernumerary seat may be increased by the regulators to 10 per institute"". While AICTE has decided to increase seats, other regulators are yet to move on it."

The question paper for the chemistry re-examination that they were to write later in the day had been leaked. A red-faced state government ordered the re-exam cancelled.  After a series of meetings, primary and secondary education minister Kimmane Ratnakar announced that the re-exam will be held on April 12. As a first step, the government suspended 40 employees of the department of pre-university for dereliction of duty.  Thursday's chemistry re-exam had been necessitated by the leakage of the question paper on March 21. The leakage was confirmed only after the exam was held. The exam was scrapped and a March 31 re-exam announced. The day of the re-exam turned out to be dramatic for both PU education department and the students. CID officials investigating the leakage of the March 21 paper stumbled upon a suspicious email that had landed in a student's email inbox on Wednesday night. The email was followed by some students receiving on WhatsApp what were purportedly handwritten versions of question papers set for the re-exam.CID officials swung into action and forwarded images of the handwritten versions to PU education department director Pallavi Akurathi around 3am. Akurathi told TOI she immediately compared the question papers with what had been sent to her. On finding that one handwritten version matched the actual question paper - which had been sent to exam centres - she ordered the re-exam cancelled.By 7am, word was out that the re-exam had been cancelled. Angry parents and students stormed the PU Board headquarters in Malleswaram and threw stones. This is the first time in the history of the PU Board that a re-exam question paper has been leaked.Following the leak of the March 21 paper, the PU education department filed a police complaint and the government ordered a CID investigation. Not one person has been arrested so far.Last week, Ajay Seth, principal secretary, primary education department, had promised there would be no more paper leaks. The exams started on March 11 and were to end on March 28 as per the original schedule."

Experts said question papers can't leak without the connivance of the board officials.""The leak seems to have occurred at the paper-setting stage itself. Else, we can't have repeat leaks. Someone in the know of the process is involved. To blame the tuition lobby is fine, but it doesn't thrive without support from PU board insiders. The system has degenerated. If re-exam papers are leaked, then we have reached a point of no return,"" a former PU board director said.Unlike other boards which have a fool-proof question paper storage system, PU papers are deposited in the state treasury once they are prepared for the year. The multiple sets of question papers are an eyewash. ""The question papers are tweaked, making it easy for miscreants to hoodwink the board. If multiple sets of papers are prepared as a back-up in case of a leak, then why wasn't the second set of papers used to conduct the examinations,"" an expert said.Sources said the question paper industry spells big money. Each medical, engineering and dental seat costs a few lakhs of rupees, and unscrupulous elements target gullible parents. ""Parents and students are willing to spend a few thousand rupees to get a copy of the question paper to score good grades than forking out a couple of lakh rupees for professional courses,'' an educationist said.If the government makes degree courses affordable, then students do not resort to unfair means to pass examinations.

The re-exam had to be cancelled after a second paper leak in 10 days. Instead of setting six new sets of question papers for the II PUC chemistry re-exam, the department randomly selected - on the government's directive - one old set from those meant for March 21. This enabled the second leakage, a highly placed source told STOI. It was not the only blunder the department made.After being set in January, the question papers were printed at a secret place in another state. Surprisingly, after the chemistry paper was leaked on March 21, the state government entrusted the task of printing the paper for the March 31 re-exam to the same press. On March 7, the question papers were sent directly to the districts from the press. ""This shows that the government did not take any serious measures after the paper leaked the first time, leaving 1.7 lakh students in doldrums,"" an officer observes. To prevent another leakage, the government has ordered setting of six new sets for the April 12 re-exam. The question papers will be printed in a different press outside Karnataka."
Stir fallout? JNU admission applications drop by 4.5%,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Stir-fallout-JNU-admission-applications-drop-by-4-5/articleshow/51624559.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the first time in five years, the number of applications for admission into Jawaharlal Nehru University has dropped. The varsity administration said the 4.5% decline in aspirants for social sciences and general science courses was not alarming but didn't rule out the possibility of the recent political turmoil on the campus having deterred some students from applying.The varsity has received 76,091 applications for this year's JNU entrance examination (JNUEE for general sciences and social sciences), down from 79,714 last year but higher than the 2014-15 figure.In addition, applicants for biotechnology programmes reduced from 8,203 in 2015-16 to 6,347 this year. But applications for these courses have been dropping steadily in the past years. Cumulatively, JNU received 5,479 less applications this year for its undergraduate, postgraduate and research programmes.  ""We haven't yet sliced the data region-wise. That will tell us where application numbers have decreased. But 3,000-odd is nothing,"" said Bhupinder Zutshi, JNU's director of admissions, referring to the 3,623 fewer applications in general courses.He, however, felt the ""situation"" in JNU may have deterred some applicants, especially those from north India.JNU has been in the limelight ever since an event to protest the hanging of Afzal Guru was organised on campus on February 9. Anti-national slogans were allegedly raised at the event in the univer sity. The subsequent spell of unrest -the arrest and incarceration of students and the branding of the entire varsity as ""anti-national""-has coincided exactly with the admission period.""The drop in applicants isn't much to worry about. You can't compare with just the last year. You have to take previous years into account too,"" said Sucheta De, former president of JNU students' union, who is now national president of the left-leaning All India Students' Association.Indeed, this is not the first time in recent years that applications for JNUEE have declined. In 2012, the number had dipped sharply to 62,162 from the previous year's figure of 70,452.De, however, admitted that the recent events may have had an impact on parents but said students were unaffected. ""There may be parental concerns but JNU has been able to impress upon students that we have a vibrant culture of study and dissent,"" she said.Another student activist said the number of applications were high considering what the university had gone through in the past two months. ""The scale and nature of the attack against JNU does not seem to have affected the admission process adversely . I'd say this is a normal admission season given the abnormal situation that prevailed during the period,"" adds Ishan Anand of Democratic Students' Federation.Zutshi said the biotechnology programmes were struggling anyway . While this year's fall of 1,856 is the sharpest in five years, the biotech courses have seen similar drop in takers before. In 2011, for instance, it had over 12,000 applicants for just one set of biotech streams while the next year, the total had fallen to 9,911. In previous years, the drop in biotech was being made up for by the steady rise in interest in general studies. Zutshi said the adverse publicity for the varsity would at best have impacted students coming from north Indian students.Read this story in Telugu"

Kumar, who is still a PhD guide to 10 students at IIT-Delhi, took charge as JNU V-C barely weeks before the controversy and has chosen not to speak much through this period.

Technical problems have thrown off the online admission schedule by almost three weeks and there's still no guarantee that further delays will be avoided.In the last week of February the education department had announced the RTE admission timetable, which listed details of the entire process to be held in three phases.First phase was to start on Feb 29 in which schools had to register online in the database being managed by National Informatics Centre (NIC), a government body. This phase has started on Sunday and will go on till March 26 at least if there are no further problems. The second phase, supposed to start on March 11, was where parents had to fill up the admission forms. This now seems likely to start by first week of April. Filling the admission form does not guarantee a seat in schools, it is merely a requirement to participate in the lottery. The lottery is the only way through which admissions can be secured in schools. The third phase will be of the admission lottery itself and that was supposed to be held from April 1. But considering the pace of progress it is likely that this will happen only after April 15.Dinkar Temkar, a Pune-based education official who is overseeing the entire process in Maharashtra, said, ""Our technical problems are being looked at by professionals and we hope to resolve them fully soon.

DU to review grading pattern following protests,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/DU-to-review-grading-pattern-following-protests/articleshow/51763598.cms,"NEW DELHI: A year after it implemented the Choice Based Credit Scheme (CBCS), Delhi University has decided to rectify the grading pattern under it after widespread protests by students who complained of their grades suffering due to the relative marking.According to agitating students, the new marking system does not take individual performances into account and grades are awarded on the basis of the average score of the class resulting in mass failure.After the first semester results were out, it was found that under the relative grading system introduced in undergraduate courses students will now have to score more than 100 per cent marks to get the top O (outstanding) grade in some subjects.The examiners will now have to convert absolute marks into letter grades and grade points through a UGC-devised formula.The Executive Council members of the varsity have also raised objections, saying the relative grading system was neither placed before the statutory bodies nor was it notified to the colleges before the results were declared.Following the concerns raised by various quarters, DU directed the CBCS committee to review the grading pattern and submit its recommendations.""The committee constituted by the Vice Chancellor to look into various aspects related with examination under CBCS held its meeting and has suggested some changes regarding computation of grades,"" a senior university official said.""The Dean of Students Welfare has sought feedback from various colleges and departments on the proposed changes following which a final decision will be taken in this regard,"" the official added.Saying that CBCS allows a ""cafeteria approach"", University Grants Commission (UGC) had in 2014 asked all central universities to implement it from the ensuing academic session.CBCS allows students 'seamless mobility' across higher education institutions along with transfer of course credits.The debate regarding CBCS intensified last year as a section among the academic fraternity rejected the proposed reforms in the education system as a ""crackdown on varsities' autonomy"".Despite opposition from a section of students and teachers, DU had gone ahead with the CBCS implementation last year saying it has been ""mandated"" by UGC and the varsity is helpless in this regard."
"Fees upfront, no-refund policy play spoilers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Fees-upfront-no-refund-policy-play-spoilers/articleshow/51608100.cms,"Pune: 'Fees once paid will not be refunded' in fine print on the admission forms of most coaching classes deters most parents and their wards from withdrawing their applications. So what happens if the quality promised by the classes is not delivered or when the student decides not to attend the class within a few days of joining? When a student in Haryana, enrolled for the Indian Institute of Technology entrance coaching at a premier institute in 2006, he did not think much about the institute's no-refund policy while signing the form. But then, instead of Gurgaon, he was told to attend classes in Delhi at least 18 km away from his home. While the student had paid Rs 68,930 for two years in advance, he cancelled his admission a few months later as the class did not start in Gurgaon.Despite many pleas, the institute refused to refund the fees which led to the student approaching the district consumer redressal forum. The district forum ruled that a refund of Rs 56,442 along with 9% interest per annum should be paid to the student along with a compensation of Rs 1 lakh. The order was upheld by both the state and the national commission in April 2013.Closer home, another such case was filed against a coaching institute by a girl student who had paid Rs 88,792 as course fees in 2011 for standard XI and XII coaching after being promised by the class administration that the lectures will be in English. Once she started attending, she realized that the teachers were using the local language and she decided to cancel her admission within a month. The coaching class refused to repay her money. The family filed a complaint with the Pune's consumer forum. On September 17, 2014, the forum ruled that after deducting Rs 2,000 for the days when she attended the class and administrative charges, the rest of the fees should be refunded. The forum also told the coaching class to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation to the girl.While experts said the law is always on the students' side when it comes to fees refund, coaching classes claim that they take a big hit financially when students leave midway.Nikhil Bhatnagar, student-mentor and admission manager at FIITJEE Pune, said the coaching class will be at a loss if the refund policy is allowed. ""Our classes start in May. So if a student decides in August or September that he is unable to cope up with studies, and wants to quit, it is hard for us to refund the fees. Almost all students have by then joined various institutes and it is not possible to enrol anyone new midway. Secondly, it will also open the floodgates and make survival of coaching classes impossible,"" he added.Bhatnagar said parents must sit with their wards and discuss whether they really want to take IIT or medical entrance exams. ""We also tell them to get an aptitude test done. The IIT or medical entrance preparations are tough. Juggling school and coaching is even tougher. We tell students what the entire course will entail and take an informed decision. If a student has a medical condition or if there is an extreme case, we send the matter to our Delhi office for further deliberations,"" added Bhatnagar.Durgesh Mangeshkar, director of IIT Pratishthan, said both parents and the coaching institute should be careful while understanding and stating terms about money. ""Coaching institutes should write their terms clearly regarding the fees and give copies to the parents as it is the main point of contention,"" he said.Mangeshkar said in many instances fees is paid in cash and negotiations, and demand for discounts further leads to ambiguity and misunderstanding when a student wishes to leave.Rajini B, parent of a standard IX student, said, ""The no-refund policy is bad and affects middle-class families. Our income is limited and hence there is only a set amount earmarked for education. But if my ward refuses to attend an institute, it becomes hard for us to pay fees for a new institute. This is not just limited to coaching classes, even many colleges refuse to refund the fees. The government should look into this as education is most important for a middle-class family.""Case in Pune 2012The parent of a 17-year-old student had filed a case against an IIT-JEE coaching institute, for refusal to refund the fees after the student cancelled her admission.""My daughter was a brilliant student till standard X, and she had studied in a convent school all her life. She faced difficulty in keeping up with the classes for competitive exams since technical subjects like physics and chemistry were not taught in English. I had forced her to take admission, as the institute was a popular one. They had taken the entire fees upfront, but refused to return any of it saying it was mentioned in the prospectus. We were ready to forego a month's fees, but they would not listen. I decided to file a case against them with the consumer forum,"" the mother said.After two years, the consumer forum ruled in favour of the parent who had taken help from an education sector lawyer, and had directed the coaching institute to refund the entire fees of Rs 89,000.""We got to know that children of many others had left the institute, but did not speak up, although they had to pay the fees again when the students joined other institutes. I urge every parent to fight for their rights as it is the question of their child's career and their hard- earned money,"" she added.VoicesThere is a dire need for regulations for coaching institutes, especially about the fees, minimum qualifications of teachers and the infrastructure. Students or parents can take legal action against a coaching institute if they are mis-selling through misleading advertisements and failing to keep their promises. Even if conditions for the refund of fees are not spelt out clearly or discussed, parents can demand a refund. Payments to anyone should be proportional to the services rendered. - Ravi Bhardwaj, education lawyer and founder EdulegalIt has become a trend to take the entre fees upfront as there are no guidelines. They face problems when students leave mid-course, which often happens. The coaching institutes also have no aid from the government, hence have no financial buffer to fall back on. - Durgesh Mangeshkar, director of IIT PratishthanThe Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) had in December 2015, upheld complaints against 19 coaching classes, which were among the 51 out of 98 complaints against advertisement claims.The list included institutes which were providing coaching for MBA entrance exams - GMAT and CAT, for GRE, JEE among others.ASCI stated that claims made by the institutes were not substantiated."

"Private universities, colleges forge new paths to raise quality of higher education",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/Private-universities-colleges-forge-new-paths-to-raise-quality-of-higher-education/articleshow/51700789.cms,"Autonomous institutions have USP of designing courses that suit industry requirementsState and centrally-funded institutions from Tamil Nadu may have made it to the top in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), but a large number of private universities and colleges have also ranked among the top institutions. And at a time when the state has faced criticism on increasing vacancy in engineering colleges, some of these private institutions lead the way in improving the quality of higher education. VIT University, Vellore, has been ranked 13, only after the 11 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and one National Institute of Technology (NIT).VIT has worked out innovative teaching-learning methodologies, improved its research activities, and implemented practical-oriented learning to emerge as one of the leading private engineering institutions in the country, its chancellor G Viswanathan said.""In 2003, when we implemented the entrance exam, we received 7,500 applications, and this year it touched 2.12 lakh. This is because of a fully flexible credit system that we have implemented on our campus which allows students to choose their subjects according to the credits they would like to earn, choose their faculty and timing of lecture as well,"" he said. The university also believes in practical-oriented learning. ""Many engineering institutions follow the same 10-year-old experiments for the laboratory sessions. But, at VIT, we closely follow industry problems in each sector, and introduce them as our lab experiments,"" Viswanathan said.A similar factor is Coimbatore's PSG College of Technology's USP. The college took the 24th rank. ""Our relation with the industry allows us to stay ahead of others. The fact that we are an autonomous institution gives us the advantage of designing our courses as per industry needs,"" principal R Rudramurthy said. ""We could also set up 45 centres of excellence across different fields of engineering and technology. This boosts our research, and in-turn, our students get good placements,"" he said.Another factor that leading technical institutes are focusing on is the intellectual property rights of their research. Dean, planning and development, SASTRA University, Thanjavur, S Vaidhyasubramaniam says the university will try to increase its patent count in the coming years.""In the next two to three years, our focus will be on converting more research work into patents,"" he said."
