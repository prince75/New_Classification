Nasa images unveil origins of solar wind,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nasa-images-unveil-origins-of-solar-wind/articleshow/54016462.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa scientists have for the first time imaged the edge of the Sun, enabling them to describe the mysterious origins of solar wind.Ever since the 1950s discovery of the solar wind â€” the constant flow of charged particles from the Sun â€” there has been a disconnect between this outpouring and the Sun itself.As it approaches Earth, the solar wind is gusty and turbulent. But near the Sun where it originates, this wind is structured in distinct rays, much like a child's simple drawing of the Sun.The details of the transition from defined rays in the corona, the Sun's upper atmosphere, to the solar wind have been, until now, a mystery.Now, using Nasa's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, scientists have for the first time imaged the edge of the Sun and described that transition, where the solar wind starts.Defining the details of this boundary helps us learn more about our solar neighbourhood, which is bathed throughout by solar material â€” a space environment that we must understand to safely explore beyond our planet, researchers said.""Now we have a global picture of solar wind evolution,"" said Nicholeen Viall, scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre in the US.""This is really going to change our understanding of how the space environment develops,"" said Viall.Both near Earth and far past Pluto, our space environment is dominated by activity on the Sun.The Sun and its atmosphere are made of plasma - a mix of positively and negatively charged particles which have separated at extremely high temperatures, that both carries and travels along magnetic field lines.Material from the corona streams out into space, filling the solar system with the solar wind.However, scientists found that as the plasma travels further away from the Sun, things change: The Sun begins to lose magnetic control, forming the boundary that defines the outer corona - the very edge of the Sun.""As you go farther from the Sun, the magnetic field strength drops faster than the pressure of the material does,"" said Craig DeForest, physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.""Eventually, the material starts to act more like a gas, and less like a magnetically structured plasma,"" said DeForest.Twenty million miles from the Sun, the solar wind plasma is tenuous, and contains free-floating electrons which scatter sunlight. This means they can be seen, but they are very faint and require careful processing.In order to resolve the transition zone, scientists had to separate the faint features of the solar wind from the background noise and light sources over 100 times brighter: the background stars, stray light from the sun itself and even dust in the inner solar system.The finding was published in The Astrophysical Journal."

Country's air-breathing rocket 'scramjets' its way into space,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Countrys-air-breathing-rocket-scramjets-its-way-into-space/articleshow/53904337.cms,"CHENNAI: Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has successfully tested two `air breathing' scramjet engines as the first step to perfect a futuristic technology to launch missiles, inject heavier satellites in orbit, and fly astronauts at hypersonic speed. If fitted to a spaceplane, the engine can cut down inter-continental travel time and fly people in just an hour across the globe to New York.The engine, which use oxygen from the atmosphere to provide propulsion along with Hydrogen stored in the rocket, was developed at Rs 35crore. During the five minute test on Sunday, the scramjet engine auto-ignited and burned fuel for five seconds at an altitude of 20km after taking off on two RH-560 (Rohini) sounding rockets at Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) director K Sivan said, ""We have got good results. It is only a baby step, but an important step, towards developing the full fledged technology. We need to determine what should be our next step, to demonstrate which aspect of the technology"".It will take up to three decades and more test flights to have a fully developed scramjet engine in a launch vehicle. Scramjet engines are different from conventional rocket engines that carry fuel (hydrogen) and oxidiser (oxygen) to propel a rocket. The hypersonic engine, with its air breathing propulsion system, would carry only liquid hydrogen as fuel and takes oxygen from the atmosphere which it touches supersonic speed to burn the fuel for propulsion. The engine, which will propel vehicles at hypersonic speed, will reduce rocket weight by half, increase its efficiency, cut down the cost and enable carrying heavier payload. Isro will conduct a lot more experiments with the engine including tests at different speeds and fine-tuning use of new materials like Inconel (an alloy of nickel, chromium and iron) and a carbon-carbon composite. ""Sunday's test of autoigniting the scramjet engine was similar to lighting a match during a cyclone,"" said Sivan. After the rocket reached an altitude of 7km, the first stage broke off and fell into the Bay of Bengal. When the second stage, to which two scramjet engines were fixed, auto-ignited, the rocket had reached 20km altitude at Mach 6 (7408.8kmph) and the flame sustained for five seconds, burning the fuel.By successfully testing a twin-scramjet engine, India has joined an elite group of countries like US, Japan, China, Russia and Europe that has demonstrated the technology which can be used to make a spaceplane. Isro's immediate plan, however, is not to make a spaceplane. It is looking to integrate the engine with a reusable launch vehicle which is under development. There is a plan to design and develop a new vehicle that may look like a plane for the engine as it cannot be used in existing launch vehicles. While scramjet technology is not a replacement for cryogenic engines and will only be a supplement, Isro is also looking to develop a technology using air-breathing propulsion system where the air flow into the engine is compressed, converted into liquid oxygen and stored for use as fuel by the rocket after it leaves the atmosphere.Sivan said, ""The cost of Sunday's flight was Rs 3 crore."""

Our bain carries out calculations without us being aware of it: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Our-bain-carries-out-calculations-without-us-being-aware-of-it-Study/articleshow/53907990.cms,"NEW DELHI: You may not be aware, but your brain can perform complicated calculations of probabilities very fast, something that you may not ever be able to do with a paper and pen. This emerges from a new study by Princeton University researchers that shows our brains can accurately track the likelihood of several different explanations for what we see around us. They traced these abilities to a region of the brain located just behind our eyes known as the orbitofrontal cortex. This work was published on July 27 in the Journal of Neuroscience.""Our brains are horrible at arithmetic. Our implicit computations are so much better than our explicit computations,"" said co-author Kenneth Norman, professor of psychology and PNI.First author Stephanie Chan, who earned her doctorate in neuroscience from Princeton in 2016, hypothesized that the brain keeps track of these possibilities in a way that is simpler than a comprehensive description of the situation, but more complex than a single explanation.""When I try to cross the street, I'm not actually analyzing every bit of the scene,"" said Yael Niv, an associate professor of psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) who co-authored the study. ""I'm constructing a narrative that I base my decision on, such as, 'That car is slowing down because of the red light.'""To study these implicit computations, the team tracked the brain activity of participants as they explored a virtual ""safari park"" split into four zones -- blue, green, pink and yellow. Each zone contained a different assortment of elephants, giraffes, hippos, lions and zebras. The task forced the brain to use previous observations of these animals to decide in which colored zones various arrangements of the animals were likely to be found.Participants were consistently able to correctly choose the more likely of the two zones. Participants' accuracy didn't suffer when choosing between two zones which were not the most likely overall, indicating that they could track the relative likelihood of all four zones.To find out where the brain performs this feat, the researchers had participants perform the task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which reveals the regions of the brain that are most active at a given time. The researchers expected the brain to track the situation as a series of four probabilities -- one for each zone -- so they looked for brain regions in which the pattern of activity changed together with the four probabilities.The best match for this search was the orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in carrying out complex plans, learning how a setting or situation has changed since last seen and high-order thinking. The findings refine the previous hypotheses that this region of the brain provides intellectual flexibility, Niv said. ""It's not just the flexibility area, it's your model of how the situation works,"" she said.Knowing when to change that model -- whether you're moving from zone-to-zone in a virtual safari, or place-to-place in the habitats of our evolutionary predecessors -- would have given our ancestors an advantage over animals that behave by the same rules in all situations. ""There's an adaptive advantage to having a brain that can say that the world works differently in different situations, but then you need to be able to figure out which area is relevant right now,"" Norman said. ""That's what the orbitofrontal cortex seems to do."""
ISRO to test scramjet engine on Sunday,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/ISRO-to-test-scramjet-engine-on-Sunday/articleshow/53887458.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The countdown to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s Scramjet engine test launch is set to begin tonight.It will be launched on board the RH-560 sounding rocket on Sunday. Eventually, the scramjet with its Air Breathing Propulsion System technology will power the Advanced Re-usable Launch Vehicle (ARLV).Lead Scientists of ISRO units including Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) and Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) here have headed to Sriharikota for the launch on Sunday.""Now, the mission readiness meet and initial tests are complete and the scramjet is set for its launch on board the Rohini series sounding rocket RH 560 on August 28. The countdown to the test will be few hours which will begin tonight for the test launch on Sunday. Later stage, it will be tested for its application in Advanced RLV,"" VSSC director K Sivan told TOI.When contacted, LPSC director S Somnath also indicated that the scramjet with its ABPS technology, test is set for Sunday. For rockets at hypersonic speeds of five times the speed of sound or Mach 5, scramjet is crucial, he said. In future it will be used for RLV mission.There is a clear need for a re-usable and responsive launch vehicle such as RLV. Such a launch vehicle can be return to earth after inserting the payload into designated orbit. It can be re-used with minor refurbishment ensuring a fast turnaround time between launches, VSSC scientists said. The first step towards that is an effective scramjet with its ABPS technology.ABPS technology in the scramjet engine uses atmospheric air as oxidiser for combustion with rocket fuel as a propellant. As the engine inhales atmospheric oxygen, it spares the rocket or launch vehicle the need to carry oxidisers, thus relieving it from increased payload space. It also reduces the cost of space travel by at least one tenth, thus making space launches more economical.The scramjet with ABPS technology test was planned for launch on July 21 this year which was postponed to a later date by ISRO on grounds that it was assisting the search operations to locate the missing IAF aircraft AN-32, with the support of its radars and satellite imagery. The test was planned for 260 seconds on RH-560 rocket with lift off to 70 km at a speed of six times the speed of sound or Mach 6.Unlike the conventional jet engines that require compressors and turbines pressure to ignite the fuel, a scramjet is a jet engine that forcefully compress the incoming air while at supersonic speed to ignite the fuel. A scramjet or supersonic combusting ramjet is an innovative variant of a ramjet air breathing jet engine in which combustion takes place in supersonic airflow. A scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress the incoming air before combustion, but a ramjet decelerates the air to subsonic level which is less than speed of sound before ignition. Whereas the airflow in a scramjet is supersonic or faster than the speed of sound throughout the entire engine which allows it to operate at over five times the speed of sound or Mach 5ISRO has also lined up the launch of INSAT-3DR, Indian satellite for weather forecast on board GSLV-Mark II on Sept 8. Following that, the PSLV-C35 mission is set for Sept 28 for to launch eight satellites. It includes three Indian satellites led by ScatSat-1 for weather forecast and cyclone prediction"

We need to at least double the number of satellites to be able to give a reasonable service to the nation,"" Kumar said speaking at the fifth edition of the Bengaluru Space Expo.For the number of satellites to double up, he said, Isro must also enhance launch capability and reduce satellite-building time. ""We are now reaching a stage where we can launch one satellite a month, but that must be increased to at least 1.5 or two launches a month,"" he said, indicating that Isro wishes to launch anywhere between 18-24 missions every year.That said, we are unable to enhance the launch frequency as we do not have the supply chain required for so many launchesâ€”and urged the private industry to participate more actively with Isro.""We need to overcome this, not only to meet our demand but also because there is a huge global market that you (private industry) can enter.The industry must have a greater share, but I know it is not easy as there are some restrictive areas, the process to change which has begun. I will assure you all the support,"" he said.Pointing to the global market, he said: ""The world is looking at putting in place a constellation of 900 satellites for just internet in the next couple of years. There are also other avenues like Asteroid Mining and so on, the potential is great.""Rakesh S, Chairman of Antrix, Isro's commercial arm, said: ""Space technology will play a key role in all our lives in the future and as of 2015 the global space market was $330 billion and nearly 75% of that was the satellites market. If the private industry is ready, there will be a lot of opportunities.""He added that the industry must change its relationship from being just a service provider to one that can build systems for Isro and eventually for themselves to sell in the market. Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) Karnataka head, Ravi Raghavan, while conceding that the industry has not done as well in space as in defence and aerospace, said: ""This is despite Isro being one fo the first government agencies to work closely with the industry."""

New method may narrow down search for Earth 2.0: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-method-may-narrow-down-search-for-Earth-2-0-Study/articleshow/53859384.cms,"WASHINGTON: A new method for analysing the chemical composition of stars may help scientists winnow the search for Earth-like planets where life like ours can form, a new study has found.Researchers from Yale University in the US have found a computational modelling technique that gives a clearer sense of the chemistry of stars, showing the conditions present when their planets formed.The system creates a new way to assess the habitability and biological evolution possibilities of planets outside our solar system, researchers said.""This is a very useful, easy diagnostic to tell whether that pale blue dot you see is more similar to Venus or the Earth,"" said Debra Fischer, a Yale professor of astronomy.""Our field is very focused on finding Earth 2.0, and anything we can do to narrow the search is helpful,"" said Fischer.Lead author John Michael Brewer, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale, has used the technique previously to determine temperature, surface gravity, rotational speed, and chemical composition information for 1,600 stars, based on 15 elements found within those stars.The new study looked at roughly 800 stars, focusing on their ratio of carbon to oxygen, and magnesium to silicon.Brewer explained that understanding the makeup of stars helps researchers understand the planets in orbit around them.""We're getting a look at the primordial materials that made these planets. Knowing what materials they started with leads to so much else,"" he said.For instance, the study shows that in many cases, carbon is not the driving force in planetary composition.Brewer found that if a star has a carbon/oxygen ratio similar to or lower than that of our own Sun, its planets have mineralogy dominated by the magnesium/silicon ratio.About 60 per cent of the stars in the study have magnesium/silicon ratios that would produce Earth-like compositions; 40 per cent of the stars have silicate-heavy interiors.""This will have a profound impact on determining habitability. It will help us make better inferences about which planets will be ones where life like ours can form,"" Brewer said.In addition to helping identify planets more like Earth, the study sheds light on the occurrence of ""diamond"" planets - planets with a high carbon-to-oxygen abundance.Brewer and Fischer found that it is ""exceedingly rare"" to find a star with a carbon/oxygen ratio high enough to produce a diamond planet.In fact, the new data shows that the star of the much discussed diamond planet, 55 Cancri e, does not have a high enough carbon/oxygen ratio to support its nickname.""They're even more rare than we thought a few years ago. Diamond planets truly are the most precious,"" Fischer said.The study appears in the Astrophysical Journal."

Antibiotics to infants ups risk of allergies in later life,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Antibiotics-to-infants-ups-risk-of-allergies-in-later-life/articleshow/54030263.cms,"Exposure to antibiotics at an early age increases risk of developing allergies like eczema and hay fever later in life according to new research presented on Tuesday at this year's European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress in London.Some previous research has suggested that early life exposure to antibiotics is associated with an increased risk of developing allergies later in life, but results are inconsistent. In this new research, Dr Fariba Ahmadizar of Utrecht University, Netherlands and colleagues identified observational studies published from January 1966 through November 11, 2015 in PubMed and Web of Science databases. Studies were included that assessed the association between antibiotic consumption during the first 2 years of life and the risk of eczema or hay fever later in life.A total of 22 studies (including 394,517 patients) were selected to study the risk of eczema and 22 studies (including 256,609 patients) to study the risk of hay fever, with some of these being the same (12 studies including 64,638 patients) studies for both conditions.Hay fever is a common allergic condition that affects up to one in five people at some point in their life. Symptoms of hay fever include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes. Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children.The increased risk of eczema due to early life use of antibiotics varied from 15% to 41% depending on the type of study analysed. Use of antibiotics in early life also increased the risk of hay fever in later life by 14% to 56% again dependent on the type of study analysed.The association was stronger if patients had been treated with 2 courses compared with one course of antibiotics both for eczema and for hay fever.The authors suggest the mechanism behind this effect is the immunomodulatory effect of antibiotics, and the disruption of the microorganisms (microbiome) in the gut caused by antibiotics which can lead to reduce immune responses.""Early life exposure to antibiotics is related to an increased risk of both eczema and hay fever later in life,"" said Dr Ahmadizar."

Be warned, as researchers have identified several species of bacteria in these products that can increase the risk of cancer, lung infections, diarrhoea and vomiting.The study found that these chewable tobacco products contains bacillus licheniformis and bacillus pumilus -- bacteria species -- that could potentially cause inflammation of the lungs, as well as many other opportunistic infections.""Some species have been identified as causative agents in spice-related outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting. Additionally, they produce a mild toxin which, in large quantities could cause illness,"" said Steven Foley, research microbiologist at the National Centre for Toxicological Research, US Food and Drug Administration.Several species of bacillus, as well as some stapphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis strains can reduce nitrates to nitrites that can potentially lead to cancer, Foley added.In order to allow nicotine to pass into the bloodstream, individuals hold these products in their mouths and thus come in close contact with mucus membranes for extended periods of time that provides an opportunity for the user to be exposed to bacteria present in the product, the researchers said.Additionally, users often have problems with gingivitis and other oral health issues that are caused by the smokeless tobacco products.Previous studies have shown the species of Staphylococci present in these products to cause heart valve infection.The gum disease, and other oral issues enables bacterial entry into the bloodstream, paving a way to the heart.The study was undertaken to better understand the potential microbiological risks associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products, and to provide a baseline microbiological risk profile of these products, Foley noted.The findings were published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology."

It has taken researchers 16 years to develop the rocket after nearly 7,000 tests.It was developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The new rocket was getting ready as China worked out a busy calendar for space missions including recurring testing of its space station currently under construction and plans to launch a probe and a rover in 2020.Completed in 2014, the Wenchang launch site is the fourth of its kind in China. Being the closest site to the equator, Wenchang boasts considerable latitudinal advantages.Satellites launched nearer the equator have a longer service life as they have a shorter journey to make it into geostationary orbit and save fuel accordingly."

Star 30 times more massive that Sun discovered,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Star-30-times-more-massive-that-Sun-discovered/articleshow/53914955.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have identified a young star in the Milky Way located almost 11,000 light years away from Earth and 30 times more massive than our Sun, which could help understand how the most massive stars form.The star is still in the process of gathering material from its parent molecular cloud, and may be even more massive when it finally reaches adulthood, researchers said.Led by a team at the University of Cambridge, researchers identified a key stage in the birth of the massive star, and found that these stars form in a similar way to much smaller stars like our Sun - from a rotating disc of gas and dust.In our galaxy, massive young stars - those with a mass at least eight times greater than the Sun - are much more difficult to study than smaller stars.This is because they live fast and die young, making them rare among the 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, and on average, they are much further away.""An average star like our Sun is formed over a few million years, whereas massive stars are formed orders of magnitude faster - around 100,000 years,"" said John Ilee from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, the study's lead author.""These massive stars also burn through their fuel much more quickly, so they have shorter overall lifespans, making them harder to catch when they are infants,"" Ilee said.The protostar that researchers identified resides in an infrared dark cloud - a very cold and dense region of space which makes for an ideal stellar nursery.However, this rich star-forming region is difficult to observe using conventional telescopes, since the young stars are surrounded by a thick, opaque cloud of gas and dust.Using the Submillimetre Array (SMA) in Hawaii and the Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, which use long wavelengths of light to observe the sky, researchers were able to 'see' through the cloud into the stellar nursery itself.By measuring the amount of radiation emitted by cold dust near the star, and by using unique fingerprints of various different molecules in the gas, the researchers were able to determine the presence of a 'Keplerian' disc - one which rotates more quickly at its centre than at its edge.""This type of rotation is also seen in the solar system - the inner planets rotate around the Sun more quickly than the outer planets,"" said Ilee.""It's exciting to find such a disc around a massive young star, because it suggests that massive stars form in a similar way to lower mass stars, like our Sun,"" he said.From these observations, the team measured the mass of the protostar to be over 30 times the mass of the Sun.In addition, the disc surrounding the young star was also calculated to be relatively massive, between two and three times the mass of our Sun.The study was published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

Lost comet lander Philae found lying in a ditch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Lost-comet-lander-Philae-found-lying-in-a-ditch/articleshow/54026952.cms,"NEW DELHI: The washing machine sized comet lander Philae has been located lying upside down in a ditch on comet 67/P 682 million kilometres (424 million miles) from Earth. It was caught by a camera on board Rosetta, the European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft orbiting the comet as it hurtles away from the sun.""THE SEARCH IS OVER! I've found @Philae2014!!"" ESA tweeted on behalf of Rosetta.The images were taken on 2 September by the OSIRIS narrow-angle camera as the orbiter came within 2.7 km of the surface and clearly show the main body of the lander, along with two of its three legs. This was the first sighting of Philae since its rough landing in November 2014.The images also provide proof of Philae's orientation, making it clear why establishing communications was so difficult following its landing on 12 November 2014.The 100-kilogramme probe touched down on comet 67P in November 2014, after a 10-year, 6.5 billion kilometre journey piggybacking on Rosetta.Rosetta's mission is slated to end in less than a month with a planned crash landing on the comet's surface. On 30 September, the orbiter will be sent on a final one-way mission to investigate the comet from close up, including the open pits in the Ma'at region, where it is hoped that critical observations will help to reveal secrets of the body's interior structure.""With only a month left of the Rosetta mission, we are so happy to have finally imaged Philae, and to see it in such amazing detail,"" says Cecilia Tubiana of the OSIRIS camera team, the first person to see the images when they were downlinked from Rosetta yesterday.Philae was last seen when it first touched down at Agilkia, bounced and then flew for another two hours before ending up at a location later named Abydos, on the comet's smaller lobe.After three days, Philae's primary battery was exhausted and the lander went into hibernation, only to wake up again and communicate briefly with Rosetta in June and July 2015 as the comet came closer to the Sun and more power was available.However, until today, the precise location was not known. Radio ranging data tied its location down to an area spanning a few tens of metres, but a number of potential candidate objects identified in relatively low-resolution images taken from larger distances could not be analysed in detail until recently."
Moderate physical activity reduces heart attack risk by 50% in seniors,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Moderate-physical-activity-reduces-heart-attack-risk-by-50-in-seniors/articleshow/53888207.cms,"NEW DELHI: If senior citizens do moderate physical activity, their chances of death by heart disease may reduce by as much as 50%, a new study has found. The research findings were presented at European Society of Cardiology Congress 2016 being held in Rome currently.The 12 year study involved nearly 2500 adults aged 65 to 74 years. High levels of physical activity led to greater risk reductions.""The role of physical activity in preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people of working age is well established,"" said Professor Riitta Antikainen, professor of geriatrics at the University of Oulu, Finland. ""But relatively little is known about the effect of regular physical activity on CVD risk in older people.""The present study assessed the association between leisure time physical activity and CVD risk and mortality in 2456 men and women aged 65 to 74 years who were enrolled into the National FINRISK Study between 1997 and 2007.The researchers classified self-reported physical activity as: Low: reading, watching TV or working in the household without much physical activity. Moderate: walking, cycling or practising other forms of light exercise (fishing, gardening, hunting) at least four hours per week.High: recreational sports (for example running, jogging, skiing, gymnastics, swimming, ball games or heavy gardening) or intense training or sports competitions at least three hours a week.During a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 197 participants died from CVD and 416 had a first CVD event.When the researchers assessed the link between physical activity and outcome they adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol) and social factors (marital status and education). To minimise reverse causality, where worse health leads to less physical activity, patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, cancer, or prior stroke at baseline were excluded from the analysis.The investigators found that moderate and high leisure time physical activity were associated with a 31% and 45% reduced risk of an acute CVD event, respectively (figure 1). Moderate and high leisure time physical activity were associated with a 54% and 66% reduction in CVD mortality.""Our study provides further evidence that older adults who are physically active have a lower risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease. The protective effect of leisure time physical activity is dose dependent - in other words, the more you do, the better. Activity is protective even if you have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as high cholesterol,"" Antikainen said""Physical exercise may become more challenging with ageing. However, it is important for older people to still get enough safe physical activity to stay healthy after their transition to retirement,"" she added."
Isro to develop tech to shift people from vehicles in space,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Isro-to-develop-tech-to-shift-people-from-vehicles-in-space/articleshow/53892654.cms,"BENGALURU: The Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) is developing a technology that will allow it to transfer humans from one vehicle or spacecraft to another in space.The immediate goal is to enable refuelling of spacecraft to give them a longer life and transfer other crucial systems to an existing spacecraft, by transporting another to space. Spacecraft docking will allow joining of two separate free-flying space vehicles. Another system called berthing will be used to transfer things from one vehicle to another.Confirming that experiments on the technology are being done at the Isro Space Application Centre (Isac), Bengaluru, senior scientist TK Anuradha, project director for the GSAT family of satellites, said: ""Isro is experimenting on docking, and there's a lot of work going on in this space. She did not, however, elaborate further.""At present, some ground simulations are happening at Isac. Favourable results will see us trying this with two small spacecraft launched for the purpose,"" another senior scientist said.""It can be used for orbit servicing of satellites, for example, as we operate a huge constellation of them,"" the scientist said. One major advantage such a technology will give Isro is the ability to enhance lives of satellites by refuelling them.Imagine a project like Astrosat, with high-end technology as part of its payload that has many years of life. The mission will end once the fuel is over. But With the docking technology, Isro could keep refuelling the space observatory.

""This suggests that the big change that made humans able to start using words was not a big change in neural capacity.""While other species probably also have the mental ability to understand language like dogs do, their lack of interest in human speech makes it difficult to test, said Andics.Dogs, on the other hand, have socialized with humans for thousands of years, meaning they are more attentive to what people say to them and how.The study was published in the journal Science.Andics also noted that all of the dogs were awake, unrestrained and happy during the tests.

The long life of the two STEREO spacecraft has been a boon for scientists studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system, the US space agency said in a statement earlier.The two STEREOs slowly drifted away from Earth as they orbited the Sun, one ahead and one behind our home planet, giving scientists constantly-improving views of the Sun's far side, allowing us for the first time to see the whole Sun at once, it added."

â€˜Draizeâ€™ irritation tests using rabbits to be phased out,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Draize-irritation-tests-using-rabbits-to-be-phased-out/articleshow/53831525.cms,"HYDERABAD: As a result of the Humane Society International/India's campaign to end cruel and obsolete animal testing, the Drug Technical Advisory Board, India's highest health advisory board, has recommended a two-year phase out period for the ""Draize"" irritation tests using rabbits. During this transition period, validated non-animal alternatives may be accepted in place of the previously mandatory animal tests.The DTAB's recommendation comes after a series of representations made by HSI/India, People for Animals and other stakeholders, informing the Central Drug Standard Control Organization and the Drug Controller General (India) regarding internationally recognized alternatives.The Draize test was developed more than 70 years ago to measure eye and skin irritation using rabbits, who are locked in restraints while a test chemical is applied to one eye or to the shaved skin on their back. Animals are monitored for up to two weeks, without pain relief, for signs of chemical damage, which can include swelling, ulceration, bleeding and blindness. In addition to its obvious cruelty, the Draize test is not reliable or relevant to humans. A variety of validated and internationally recognized non-animal alternatives, including reconstructed human skin and corneal tissues, have been available for years -- some since 2004.These 21st century technologies, deployed as part of a sequential testing strategy, allow complete replacement of the Draize eye and skin tests with methods that are more reproducible and reflective of human responses, HIS said.""The Drug Technical Advisory Board's recommendation to phase out the cruel Draize test is a step in the right direction,"" said Gauri Maulekhi, Government Affairs Liaison for HSI/India and PFA trustee. ""However, an immediate ban would have been a more appropriate response to companies that have for years smugly disregarded the ever-growing toolbox of non-animal testing methods and their legal mandate under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 to replace animal tests when alternatives are available. We expect the Health Ministry will act swiftly to notify the rule change so that companies are required to implement it as soon as possible.""This move comes after Union Minister of Women & Child Development, Maneka Sanjay Gandhi, wrote to the Ministry regarding the practice, followed by representations from HSI/India and PFA. India has been a full adherent to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development decision regarding Mutual Acceptance of Data since 2011.As a consequence, the data generated following OECD test guidelines and using Indian Good Laboratory Practice laboratories must be accepted in all the OECD member countries, and vice versa. The OECD estimates that adherence to MAD saves more than 150 million and scores of animals per year by avoiding needlessly duplicative testing."

When babies see someone eat, they are not just learning about food - they are also learning about who eats what with whom,"" said Katherine Kinzler, Associate Professor at the Cornell University in New York, US.The study supported the well-known fact in developmental psychology that babies will look longer at novel actions or things that deviate from their general expectations of the world.""An ability to think about people as being 'same versus different' and perhaps even 'us versus them' starts very early in life,"" Kinzler added.Furthermore, babies were also found to have a slightly different take when it comes to food that might harm them.When the babies saw a person act disgusted from eating a food, they expected that a second person would also be disgusted by that food - even if the second person was from a different social group.This suggests that ""infants are particularly vigilant to social information that might signal danger"".In addition, the team also discovered an insight into what babies identify as meaningful cultural differences.While monolingual babies expected people who speak different languages to like different food, bilingual babies expected that people who speak different languages would eat the same food.They might have had experience with this in their own home, where people speaking different languages are gathered around the table, the researchers explained.The results may have implications for policymakers interested in shifting people's unhealthy eating habits, they said.Moreover, parents might need to consider that their children are watching as they eat together.""If you feed your child the perfect diet, yet your child sees you and your friends and family eating junk food, she is presumably learning about foods from her social experiences, too,"" Kinzler said in the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The team set up a series of studies in which they showed more than 200 one-year-olds a series of videos of people expressing like or dislike of foods.When the babies saw two people in the video speak the same language or act as if they were friends, the infants expected them to like the same foods. However, when they saw two people who spoke different languages or acted as if they were unfriendly, the babies expected them to like different foods, the researchers concluded."
Face transplants: The ups and downs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Face-transplants-The-ups-and-downs/articleshow/54060159.cms,"PARIS: Ten years and 36 operations later, the face transplant+ remains a tricky endeavour+ with a long list of health and mental risks to be weighed against the benefits, experts say.A major procedure, it helps many patients resume basic tasks such as breathing, eating and speaking, and restores non-verbal communication through smiles and frowns.For many, the big change+ is being able to appear in public without being stared at.But recipients also face an uphill psychological battle living with someone else's face, and life-long reliance on immunosuppressant medicines+ , with their side-effects.The drugs rein in the body's immune system, which can target a transplant organ as a foreign intruder to be attacked and wiped out.But in checking this protective response, the body is left vulnerable to a wide array of infections and cancers.""Anti-rejection treatments take a heavy toll on patients,"" Paris-based plastic surgeon Jean-Pierre Meningaud said after Tuesday's announcement of the death of the world's first face graft recipient, Isabelle Dinoire.Meningaud, who has performed seven such transplants, called for a hold on the procedure pending advances in immunosuppressing therapy.Every single one of his patients have had at least one rejection episode, ""which leads to higher doses of drugs, and with them, the risks,"" he told AFP.Two of Meningaud's seven patients have died -- one of whom committed suicide.The university hospital of Amiens-Picardie, where Dinoire's operation was performed in November 2005, said finding the right ""balance"" between protecting the new face and the rest of the body was a tall order.On top of the risk of tumours and infections, it said, immunosuppressants can have severe side-effects such as diabetes, diminished kidney function and osteoporosis.So far, six of the 36 people to have received face transplants globally since 2005 have died.The operation itself is long, complex and not without risks, and recovery is long, say the experts.""It is important to remember that facial transplantation is still under evaluation,"" the university said in a statement.""It is listed under clinical research and is not considered a routine procedure.""Maimed by her dog, Dinoire received part of a brain-dead person's face in a historic, 15-hour operation at the age of 38.She died in April this year from a rare tumour which the hospital said ""cannot be scientifically linked to immunosuppressant treatment"" she was taking.Since the transplant, Dinoire had suffered many infections, another tumour, diminished kidney function and high blood pressure.""There are some experts that question the risk associated with face transplantation as it is not a life-saving operation,"" states the Transplantation Services department of the University of California in Los Angeles.""However, the candidates with facial disfigurement live with social isolation and fear of rejection from their appearance affecting their quality of life,"" according to its website.For Meningaud's colleague Laurent Lantieri, the procedure must be reserved for severely disfigured people with no alternative, such as regular plastic surgery.""There has not been enough of a revolution in immunology since these questions were first raised... to warrant widespread use of the technique,"" he said on France 5 television on Wednesday.For face transplant recipient Jerome Hamon, however, the procedure has been a life-changer.""I have changed, I am more open towards other people,"" he said on French radio after news broke of Dinoire's death.""The looks, the teasing, it has all disappeared.

Shift workers more susceptible to infections: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Shift-workers-more-susceptible-to-infections-Study/articleshow/53724901.cms,"LONDON: Shift workers - whose body clocks are routinely disrupted - are more prone to health problems such as infections and chronic disease, Cambridge researchers including one of Indian-origin have found.We are more susceptible to infection at certain times of the day as our body clock affects the ability of viruses to replicate and spread between cells, researchers from University of Cambridge in the UK said.When a virus enters our body, it hijacks the machinery and resources in our cells to help it replicate and spread throughout the body.However, the resources on offer fluctuate throughout the day, partly in response to our circadian rhythms - in effect, our body clock.Circadian rhythms control many aspects of our physiology and bodily functions - from our sleep patterns to body temperature, and from our immune systems to the release of hormones. These cycles are controlled by a number of genes, including Bmal1 and Clock, researchers said.To test whether our circadian rhythms affect susceptibility to, or progression of, infection, researchers compared normal 'wild type' mice infected with herpes virus at different times of the day, measuring levels of virus infection and spread.The mice lived in a controlled environment where 12 hours were in daylight and 12 hours were dark.Researchers found that virus replication in those mice infected at the very start of the day - equivalent to sunrise, when these nocturnal animals start their resting phase - was ten times greater than in mice infected ten hours into the day, when they are transitioning to their active phase.When researchers repeated the experiment in mice lacking Bmal1, they found high levels of virus replication regardless of the time of infection.""The time of day of infection can have a major influence on how susceptible we are to the disease, or at least on the viral replication, meaning that infection at the wrong time of day could cause a much more severe acute infection,"" said Akhilesh Reddy from Cambridge.""This is consistent with recent studies which have shown that the time of day that the influenza vaccine is administered can influence how effectively it works,"" said Reddy.In addition, researchers found similar time-of-day variation in virus replication in individual cell cultures, without influence from our immune system.Abolishing cellular circadian rhythms increased both herpes and influenza A virus infection, a dissimilar type of virus - known as an RNA virus - that infects and replicates in a very different way to herpes.The findings may help explain why shift workers, whose body clocks are routinely disrupted, are more prone to health problems, including infections and chronic disease.The research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."

It also plays an important role in our diet providing valuable vitamins, minerals and health promoting phytochemicals, researchers said.Plant breeders are working continuously to supply high yielding, better tasting, more nutritious and longer lasting tomato varieties, but some of the best tasting varieties soften rapidly and can have a short shelf life, they said.Researchers led by Graham Seymour from University of Nottingham in the UK have identified a gene that encodes an enzyme which plays a crucial role in controlling softening of the tomato fruit.The results could pave the way for new varieties of better tasting tomatoes with improved postharvest life through conventional plant breeding, researchers said.""To support the tomato industry and further improve consumer satisfaction with new tomato varieties, a major scientific goal has been to identify genes that allow the targeted control of fruit softening without impacting other aspects of ripening,"" said Seymour.""Such work would permit excellent fruit flavour and colour development, combined with enhanced shelf life,"" he said.In the modern supply chain shelf life is critical. To reduce wastage, this is often extended by developing hybrids that are bred to include natural mutations that slow the whole ripening process, researchers said.But improving shelf life this way can often have a detrimental effect on flavour and colour, they said.Researchers identified a gene that encodes a pectate lyase which normally degrades the pectin in the tomato cell walls during ripening.""In laboratory experiments we have demonstrated that if this gene is turned off, the fruit soften much more slowly, but still show normal changes in colour and the accumulation of taste compounds such as acids, sugars and aroma volatiles,"" said Seymour.""Natural variation exists in the levels of pectate lyase gene expression in wild relatives of cultivated tomato and these can be used for conventional breeding purposes. This discovery can provide a means to refine the control of fruit softening in modern tomato cultivars,"" he said.The findings were published in the journal Nature Biotechnology."
Smiling baby macaques reveal origin of smiles,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Smiling-baby-macaques-reveal-origin-of-smiles/articleshow/53596351.cms,"TOKYA: Researchers have found that the spontaneous smiles seen in hominoids are also common in Japanese macaques, revealing that the origin of smiles goes back at least 30 million years, when old world monkeys and our ancestors diverged.Spontaneous smiles, considered the evolutionary origin of real smiles and laughter, are facial movements that are characterised by raised lip corner that occur during irregular sleep or drowsiness without known external or internal causes.These spontaneous smiles have been found in both human infants and infant chimpanzees.For the study, the team observed 58 spontaneous smiles from seven macaque infants, all of which showed spontaneous smiles at least once.""Spontaneous macaque smiles are more like short, lop-sided spasms compared to those of human infants. There were two significant similarities; they both happened between irregular rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and they show more lop-sided smiles compared to symmetrical, full smiles,"" said Lead author Fumito Kawakami from Kyoto University, in Japan.""A major difference, though, is that the smiles were much shorter,"" Kawakami added.The findings showed that spontaneous smiles don't express feelings of pleasure in chimpanzees and Japanese monkeys, rather, the smiles are more similar to submissive signals (grimaces) rather than smiles (play faces).Further, the spontaneous smiles facilitate the development of cheek muscles, enabling humans, chimpanzees, and Japanese monkeys to produce smiles, laughs, and grimaces, the researchers said in the work published in the journal Primates.However, some researchers argued that infants' spontaneous smiles exist to make parents feel that their children are adorable and to enhance parent-child communication."
Mysterious object 'Niku' found orbiting Sun in backward orbit,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Mysterious-object-Niku-found-orbiting-Sun-in-backward-orbit/articleshow/53753936.cms,"NEW DELHI: A mysterious 200-km wide chunk of ice has been discovered beyond the orbit of Neptune, the farthest recognized-planet from our sun. Bizarrely, this object is going around the sun in a backwards direction and its orbit is tilted by 110 degrees from the plane in which all planets stay.The object has been named Niku, a Chines word for ""rebellious"" by the the international team of astronomers that made the discovery using the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS 1), Universe Today reports.Astronomers have discovered many such objects in the region beyond Neptune. These are collectively called Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). They orbit the sun at an average distance of 30 Astronomical Units or 1.5 billion km.Laws of physics dictate that when a planetary system like our Solar System forms, all the bodies orbit in the same direction. So if you look down at the Solar System from the ""top"" all objects including planets will be moving around in the counterclockwise direction. But Niku is going around clockwise. This means that some outside, unknown forces are acting on it.In fact, when compared to other TNOs, the researchers found that all of them including Niku occupied a common plane and were clustered together. As-via email:""The orbit of Niku is unusual in that it is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. More than that, it is orbiting in the opposite direction of most solar system bodies. Furthermore, there are a few bodies that share the same or orbital plane, with some orbiting prograde and some orbiting retrograde. That was unexpected,"" Dr. Matthew J. Holman, a professor at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and one of the researchers on the team told Universe Today.Although it is possible that the as yet undiscovered Planet Nine is the cause of this mysterious phenomenon, but Niku doesn't fit into that frame. However the team found that Niku is too close to the rest of the solar system for its orbit to be effected by Planet Nine.""Whenever you have some feature that you can't explain in the outer solar system, it's immensely exciting because it's in some sense foreshadowing a new development. As they say in the paper, what they have right now is a hint. If this hint develops into a complete story that would be fantastic,"" Konstantin Batyagin - the Caltech astronomer who announced findings that hinted at Planet Nine earlier this year - was quoted as saying."

Stephen Hawking's prediction about black holes observed in lab,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Stephen-Hawkings-prediction-about-black-holes-observed-in-lab/articleshow/53741029.cms,"JERUSALEM: Scientists who created a virtual black hole in the lab claim to have observed for the first time a phenomenon predicted by English physicist Stephen Hawking more than 30 years ago according to which some particles can escape black holes.Jeff Steinhauer, a physicist at the Israel Institute of Technology built a virtual black hole in the lab in order to prove that Hawking's theory of radiation emanating from black holes is correct - though his experiments are based on sound, rather than light.Steinhauer said that he observed the quantum effects of Hawking radiation in his lab as part of a virtual black hole - which, if proven to be true, will be the first time it has ever been achieved.For many years, scientists believed that nothing could ever escape from a black hole - not even light.However in 1974, Stephen Hawking suggested particles, that are now called Hawking radiation, could escape black holes.According to him if a particle and its antimatter appeared spontaneously at the edge of a black hole, one of the pair might be pulled into the black hole while the other escaped, taking some of the energy from the black hole with it.This would explain why black holes grow smaller and eventually disappear.However, since such emissions are feeble, no one has been able to measure Hawking radiation. Researchers have instead tried to build virtual black holes in labs to test the theory.Steinhauer's experiment consisted of creating an entangled pair of phonons sitting inside a bit of liquid that had been forced to move very fast and then observing the action as one of the pair was pulled away as the liquid began to move faster than the speed of sound, while the other escaped, 'Phys.org' reported.The fluid was a Bose-Enistein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms. After repeating the experiment 4,600 times, Steinhauer became convinced that the particles were entangled, a necessity for a Hawking radiation analogue.The research was published in the journal Nature Physics."

Spectacular meteor shower to light up skies this week: NASA,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Spectacular-meteor-shower-to-light-up-skies-this-week-NASA/articleshow/53599510.cms,"WASHINGTON: A cosmic display of ""shooting stars"" will light up the night skies this week during the annual Perseid meteor shower, when up to 200 meteors per hour will hit the Earth's atmosphere and disintegrate in flashes of light, according to NASA.""Forecasters are predicting a Perseid outburst this year with double normal rates on the night of August 11-12,"" said Bill Cooke from NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office in the US.The Perseids show up every year in August when Earth ventures through trails of debris left behind by an ancient comet.This year, Earth may be in for a closer encounter than usual with the comet trails that result in meteor shower, setting the stage for a spectacular display.""Under perfect conditions, rates could soar to 200 meteors per hour,"" said Cooke.An outburst is a meteor shower with more meteors than usual. The last Perseid outburst occurred in 2009.Every Perseid meteor is a tiny piece of the comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the Sun every 133 years. Each swing through the inner solar system can leave trillions of small particles in its wake.When Earth crosses paths with Swift-Tuttle's debris, specks of comet-stuff hit Earth's atmosphere and disintegrate in flashes of light.These meteors are called Perseids because they seem to fly out of the constellation Perseus.Most years, Earth might graze the edge of Swift-Tuttle's debris stream, where there is less activity.Occasionally, Jupiter's gravity tugs the huge network of dust trails closer, and Earth ploughs through closer to the middle, where there is more material.This may be one of those years, NASA said. Experts agree that three or more streams are on a collision course with Earth.""The meteors you'll see this year are from comet flybys that occurred hundreds if not thousands of years ago,"" said Cooke.""They have travelled billions of miles before their kamikaze run into Earth's atmosphere,"" he said.The best way to see the Perseids is to go outside between midnight and dawn on the morning of August 12.""Allow about 45 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. Lie on your back and look straight up. Increased activity may also be seen on August 12-13,"" NASA said.Perseid meteors travel at the blistering speed of 59 kilometres per second.At that speed, even a smidgen of dust makes a vivid streak of light when it collides with Earth's atmosphere. Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,600 to 5,500 degrees Celsius as they speed across the sky.The Perseids pose no danger to Earth. Most burn up 80 km above our planet. However, an outburst could mean trouble for spacecraft."
Zika researchers seeking volunteers willing to be infected,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Zika-researchers-seeking-volunteers-willing-to-be-infected/articleshow/53772759.cms,"WASHINGTON: Wanted â€” Volunteers willing to be infected with the Zika virus for science.It may sound bizarre, but researchers are planning just such a study â€” this winter, when mosquitoes aren't biting â€” to help speed development of much-needed Zika vaccines.The quest for a vaccine began less than a year ago as Brazil's massive outbreak revealed that Zika, once dismissed as a nuisance virus, can harm a fetus' brain if a woman is infected during pregnancy.Now, researchers in the United States have begun safety testing of two vaccine candidates, and more experimental shots are poised to enter that preliminary testing soon. Any that seem promising will have to be tested in thousands of people in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean that are hard-hit by the mosquito-borne virus â€” the only way to prove if an experimental vaccine really protects.Even if all goes well, a vaccine wouldn't be available for general use any time soon.But a different kind of research also can offer clues for vaccine development. It's called a human challenge study, when healthy â€” and nonpregnant â€” people agree to be injected deliberately with a virus, mimicking natural infection while scientists track how their bodies react.The first question is even more basic: How much of the virus does it take to infect someone?If government regulators agree, researchers could find out by injecting paid volunteers with different amounts of lab-grown Zika virus as early as December in a Baltimore hospital. That information will help the researchers later, when they're ready to test an experimental Zika vaccine.``We're looking at these human challenge protocols not only as an important step in vaccine development but as a means to learn more about Zika,'' said Dr. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is leading the work. ``We can look at things that you just can't do in someone who's naturally infected.''Some questions and answers about the development of Zika vaccines:Q: Which potential vaccines are first in line?A: Two so-called DNA vaccines have begun preliminary safety testing, one made by the National Institutes of Health and the other by Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals.They mark a new kind of technology. Traditionally, vaccines are made using a dead or weakened virus to train the body's immune system to recognize that infection and fight it off. DNA vaccines may be easier to make. Scientists used a circular piece of DNA, called a ``plasmid,'' to carry genes that prompt the body itself to produce certain Zika virus proteins, alerting the immune system.That piece of trickery worked in animals. The phase 1 studies in dozens of people will check for safety, and whether the vaccinations rev up human immunity enough to justify further tests.Q: What else is in the pipeline?A: ``We are right now in a race of time to get the best vaccine,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Multiple candidates are important as there's no way to predict which kind will work best. The DNA vaccines simply were ready for human testing first.In October, safety tests are set to begin using the more traditional killed-virus vaccine, developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.The NIH also is developing a vaccine using live-but-weakened virus, the type thought to trigger particularly long-lasting immune protection.That's the kind used to protect against rubella, which back in the 1960s caused an epidemic of birth defects.Q: If the first candidates are safe, what happens next?A: Fauci expects to open next-step studies in January, enrolling 2,400 to 5,000 people in areas where Zika still is spreading widely to test if the vaccinated are less likely than the unvaccinated to become infected.Q: Are vaccines aimed at pregnant women?A: Not at this point. It's hard to test new products during pregnancy. Plus, a fetus can be vulnerable to Zika even before a woman realizes she's pregnant.The goal instead is to vaccinate women of childbearing age and their sexual partners â€” because Zika also can be transmitted through sex â€” well before pregnancy ever occurs.Q: Where do the human challenge studies come in?A: Jabbing someone with Zika is faster than waiting around for a mosquito to bite them to see if an experimental vaccine provides protection. But first Durbin must find what dose of Zika causes infection, to be sure she's giving a vaccine enough of a challenge.That's what the study planned for December would do. Volunteers given different amounts of Zika would be kept in a Hopkins hospital unit for 12 days, to be sure the virus had cleared the bloodstream, and would have to agree to use condoms for a while afterward to avoid any possibility of sexual transmission. Because Zika usually causes few if any symptoms, those infected might expect a rash or low fever.The second round of the research would recruit volunteers who'd received an experimental vaccine, trying to infect them with Zika six months after their shot.The extra benefit: Tracking people from the moment they're exposed to Zika also could shed important new light on how the virus affects the body â€” such as how long it's infectious in blood, semen and other bodily fluids, and just how the immune system fights it off.Q: Has this been done before?A: Human challenge studies are rare because they're difficult to perform and expensive. But Durbin recently did just such research to test a potential vaccine against dengue, a dangerous cousin of Zika, and doesn't expect difficulty recruiting volunteers for the Zika study once regulators are satisfied it can be conducted safely.Q: What about the fight over federal funding for Zika?A: In February, the Obama administration requested $1.9 billion for the nation's fight against Zika, including vaccine development, but Congress hasn't approved any of it. With existing money running out, federal health officials are taking funds meant for other diseases to get by until the end of the year â€” but Fauci said NIH alone will need $196 million more in 2017 to avoid delays in the vaccine research."
"Indians prone to cancer due to obesity, alcohol intake: Experts",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Indians-prone-to-cancer-due-to-obesity-alcohol-intake-Experts/articleshow/53582757.cms,"MUMBAI: Indians are more prone to oesophageal and other types of cancer due to obesity resulting from sedentary lifestyle and improper food habits as well as alcohol intake, according to medical experts.Increase in the population affected by obesity, coupled with enhanced intake of alcohol by Indians is now posing a serious health hazard with people suffering from various forms of cancer, according to Dr M G Bhat, Bangalore-based doctor specialising in Bariatric surgery and Surgical Gastroenterology.""Obesity is associated with increased risks of various types of cancers such as oesophagus, pancreas, colon and rectum, breast (after menopause), endometrium (lining of the uterus), kidney, thyroid and gallbladder and many more possibly,"" said Bhat, who is also associated with Manipal Hospital and Apollo Spectra Hospitals in Bangalore.Dr Shashank Shah, noted Laparoscopic and Bariatric Surgeon attached to Hinduja Healthcare here, said obesity is rising in India as a part of global epidemic, however, Indians being more obese, the abdominal obesity is more prevalent.""Habits like tobacco and spices can add to reflux. The association of reflux and obesity is on rise in India and diagnosis is frequently done with endoscopy available. Hence, the treatment algorithm for reflux disease in obese people is changing to aggressive treatment of obesity since obesity is known to be the major contributory factor,"" he said.According to Bhat, ""Fat tissues produce oestrogen, and its high levels enhance the risk of breast and endometrial cancers. Similarly, often increased insulin or insulin like growth factors present in higher levels in obese people may promote certain types of tumors such as Leptin.""A recently concluded new global research by American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) has established that an overweight person carries a great risk of developing the most common type of oesophageal cancer, while drinking alcohol increases the risk of the second major type of this cancer."
Getting a viral fever? Its severity may depend on what time it hit you,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Getting-a-viral-fever-Its-severity-may-depend-on-what-time-it-hit-you/articleshow/53721540.cms,"Whether you get a severe bout of a viral infection like cold or flu, or a mild one may depend upon when the virus first invaded your body. This is suggested by new research done by scientists at the University of Cambridge. It seems that our body clock affects the ability of viruses to replicate and spread between cells. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""The time of day of infection can have a major influence on how susceptible we are to the disease, or at least on the viral replication, meaning that infection at the wrong time of day could cause a much more severe acute infection,"" explains Professor Akhilesh Reddy, the study's senior author. ""This is consistent with recent studies which have shown that the time of day that the influenza vaccine is administered can influence how effectively it works.""When a virus enters our body, it hijacks the machinery and resources in our cells to help it replicate and spread throughout the body. However, the resources on offer fluctuate throughout the day, partly in response to our circadian rhythms - in effect, our body clock. Circadian rhythms control many aspects of our physiology and bodily functions - from our sleep patterns to body temperature, and from our immune systems to the release of hormones.These cycles are controlled by a number of genes, including Bmal1 and Clock.To test whether our circadian rhythms affect susceptibility to, or progression of, infection, researchers compared normal 'wild type' mice infected with herpes virus at different times of the day, measuring levels of virus infection and spread. The mice lived in a controlled environment where 12 hours were in daylight and 12 hours were dark.The researchers found that virus replication in those mice infected at the very start of the day - equivalent to sunrise, when these nocturnal animals start their resting phase - was ten times greater than in mice infected ten hours into the day, when they are transitioning to their active phase. When the researchers repeated the experiment in mice lacking Bmal1, they found high levels of virus replication regardless of the time of infection.In addition, the researchers found similar time-of-day variation in virus replication in individual cell cultures, without influence from our immune system. Abolishing cellular circadian rhythms increased both herpes and influenza A virus infection, a dissimilar type of virus - known as an RNA virus - that infects and replicates in a very different way to herpes.""Given that our body clocks appear to play a role in defending us from invading pathogens, their molecular machinery may offer a new, universal drug target to help fight infection,"" adds Professor Reddy."
Young massive star identified in the Milky Way,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Young-massive-star-identified-in-the-Milky-Way/articleshow/53806055.cms,"LONDON: A team of astronomers has identified a young star, located almost 11,000 light years away, which could help us understand how the most massive stars in the universe are formed.This young star, already more than 30 times the mass of our Sun ""is still in the process of gathering material from its parent molecular cloud, and may be even more massive when it finally reaches adulthood"".An average star like our Sun is formed over a few million years, whereas massive stars are formed in orders of magnitude faster, around 100,000 years.""These massive stars also burn through their fuel much more quickly, so they have shorter overall lifespan, making them harder to catch when they are infants,"" said Dr John Ilee from University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy.The protostar that Ilee and his colleagues identified resides in an infrared dark cloud - a very cold and dense region of space which makes for an ideal stellar nursery.By using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii and the Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, the researchers were able to ""see"" through the cloud and into the stellar nursery itself.The researchers identified a key stage in the birth of a very massive star and found that these stars form in a similar way to much smaller stars like our Sun - from a rotating disc of gas and dust.The team was able to determine the presence of a ""Keplerian"" disc - one which rotates more quickly at its centre than at its edge.""This type of rotation is also seen in the solar system - the inner planets rotate around the Sun more quickly than the outer planets,"" said Ilee.""It's exciting to find such a disc around a massive young star, because it suggests that massive stars form in a similar way to lower mass stars, like our Sun,"" the author noted."
Scientists turn to satellite images to map poverty,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Scientists-turn-to-satellite-images-to-map-poverty/articleshow/53765937.cms,"WASHINGTON: Locating people living in poverty, such as through door-to-door surveys, sometimes is difficult. Therefore, scientists are now turning to satellite images.In a study published on Thursday in the US journal Science, researchers from the Stanford University used machine learning, the science of designing computer algorithms that learn from data, to extract information about poverty from high-resolution satellite imagery, Xinhua news agency reported.They found the newly developed approach was able to ""make fairly accurate predictions"" of impoverished areas across five African countries: Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda.""Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries,"" the researchers said in their paper.According to World Bank data from 2000 to 2010, 39 out of 59 African countries conducted less than two surveys, from which nationally representative poverty measures could be constructed.Overall, surveys are costly, infrequent, and cannot always reach countries or regions within countries, for instance, due to armed conflict.Recent studies showed that satellite data capturing nightlights can be used to predict wealth in a given area.However, nightlight data alone is not effective at differentiating between regions at the bottom end of the income distribution, where satellite images appear uniformly dark.To circumvent this problem, the new study turned its attention to daylight imagery, which offers higher resolution and can capture features such as paved roads and metal roofs, markers that can help distinguish poor and ultra-poor regions.The researchers then developed a sophisticated learning algorithm that categorizes these features and found that this method did a surprisingly good job predicting the distribution of poverty.Compared with nightlight models, the new model was 81 per cent more accurate in predicting poverty in regions under the poverty line, and 99 per cent more accurate in areas that are two times below the poverty line.""We demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high- resolution satellite imagery,"" the study said.""It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains."""
NASA's asteroid mission to test concepts for journey to Mars,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/NASAs-asteroid-mission-to-test-concepts-for-journey-to-Mars/articleshow/53720740.cms,"WASHINGTON: In a bid to validate concepts for the future manned journey to Mars, NASA has approved the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) to proceed to the next phase of design and development for the mission's robotic segment.ARM is a two-part mission that will integrate robotic and crewed spacecraft operations in the proving ground of deep space to demonstrate key capabilities needed for NASA's journey to the red planet.The robotic component of ARM will demonstrate the world's most advanced and most efficient solar electric propulsion system as it travels to a near-Earth asteroid (NEA).NEAs are asteroids that are fewer than 194 million km from the Sun at the closest point in their orbit.Although the target asteroid is not expected to be officially selected until 2020, NASA is using 2008 EV5 as the reference asteroid while the search continues for potential alternatives.A target asteroid such as 2008 EV5 is particularly appealing to the scientific, exploration, and industrial communities because it is a primitive, C-type (carbonaceous) asteroid, believed to be rich in volatiles, water and organic compounds, NASA said.The ability to extract core samples from the captured boulder will allow us to evaluate how its composition varies with depth and could unlock clues to the origins of our solar system.Astronaut sampling and potential commercial activities could indicate the value of C-type asteroids for commercial mining purposes, which in turn could have significant impacts on how deep space missions are designed in the future.After collecting a multi-tonne boulder from the asteroid, the robotic spacecraft will slowly redirect the boulder to an orbit around the Moon, using its gravity for an assist, where NASA plans to conduct a series of proving ground missions in the 2020s.There, astronauts will be able to select, extract, collect and return samples from the multi-tonne asteroid mass, and conduct other human-robotic and spacecraft operations in the proving ground that will validate concepts for NASA's journey to Mars.The crewed segment, targeted for launch in 2026, remains in an early mission concept phase, or pre-formulation.ARM will demonstrate advanced, high-power, high-throughput solar electric propulsion; advanced autonomous high-speed proximity operations at a low-gravity planetary body; controlled touchdown and liftoff with a multi-tonne mass from a low-gravity planetary body.It will also demonstrate astronaut spacewalk activities for sample selection, extraction, containment and return; and mission operations of integrated robotic and crewed vehicle stack - all key components of future in-space operations for human missions to Mars."

New compound shows hope for prostate cancer therapy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-compound-shows-hope-for-prostate-cancer-therapy/articleshow/53612973.cms,"NEW YORK: Researchers have identified a novel compound that can block testosterone from fuelling the tumours in mice and act as a new generation therapy for prostate cancer.""Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men, and the principal driver of tumour growth is the androgen receptor,"" said John D Norris, Associate Professor at Duke University in North Carolina, US.The new compound, called tetraaryl cyclobutane, or CB, is being studied as an option for prostate tumours that have grown resistant to current anti-androgen drugs, notably enzalutamide.""Suppression of androgen receptor function by anti-endocrine therapies is initially effective, but most tumours develop resistance, resulting in a more aggressive cancer,"" Norris added.The new compound act as competitive inhibitors of androgen receptors, but are structurally different from current anti-androgens such as enzalutamide.One of the CB compounds, inhibits mutant forms of the androgen receptors that promote resistance to enzalutamide.It functions by preventing the androgen receptor from entering the nucleus of the cell where it can promote tumour growth.""It's encouraging that this compound has a different mechanism of action when compared to current therapies, which gives it a good chance of having efficacy in resistant disease,"" Norris said.Animal models have showed that the compound is active against prostate tumours where enzalutamide fails, the researchers concluded in the paper published online in the journal Nature Chemical Biology."
Nasa's Curiosity rover beams 360-degree panorama of Mars,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nasas-Curiosity-rover-beams-360-degree-panorama-of-Mars/articleshow/53785146.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover has captured a stunning 360-degree panoramic view of features called 'Murray Buttes', combining more than 130 images taken on the fourth anniversary of probe's landing on the red planet.The image was acquired by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on as the rover neared on lower Mount Sharp on Mars, during the afternoon of the mission's 1,421st Martian day.The visual drama of Murray Buttes along Curiosity's planned route up lower Mount Sharp was anticipated when the site was informally named nearly three years ago, Nasa said.A butte is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top. Mesa is an elevated area that has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.The buttes and mesas of Murray Buttes are capped by material that is relatively resistant to erosion, just as is the case with many similarly shaped buttes and mesas on Earth.This helps preserve these monumental remnants of a layer that formerly more fully covered the underlying layer that the rover is now driving on.In the image a dark, flat-topped mesa is seen towards the left, which is about 90 meters from the rover's position. It stands about about 15 meters high.A horizontal ledge near the top of the mesa is about 60 metres across. An upper portion of Mount Sharp appears on the distant horizon to the left of this mesa in the image.The relatively flat foreground is part of a geological layer called the Murray formation, which formed from lakebed mud deposits.The buttes and mesas rising above this surface are eroded remnants of ancient sandstone that originated when winds deposited sand after lower Mount Sharp had formed.Curiosity closely examined that layer - known as the Stimson formation - during the first half of 2016 while crossing a feature called ""Naukluft Plateau"" between two exposures of the Murray formation.The scene is presented with a colour adjustment that approximates white balancing, to resemble how the rocks and sand would appear under daytime lighting conditions on Earth.Early in its mission on Mars, Curiosity accomplished its main goal when it found and examined an ancient habitable environment.In an extended mission, the rover is examining successively younger layers as it climbs the lower part of Mount Sharp.A key goal is to learn how freshwater lake conditions, which would have been favourable for microbes billions of years ago if Mars has ever had life, evolved into harsher, arid conditions much less suited to supporting life. The mission is also monitoring the modern environment of Mars."
US government shifts $81 million to Zika vaccine research,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/US-government-shifts-81-million-to-Zika-vaccine-research/articleshow/53664865.cms,"CHICAGO/WASHINGTON: The US Department of Health and Human Services has shifted $81 million in funds from other projects to continue work on developing vaccines to fight Zika in the absence of any funding from US lawmakers.In a letter addressed to Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and minority leader of the US House of Representatives, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said she was allocating $34 million in funding to the National Institutes of Health and $47 million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to work on Zika vaccines.Burwell said the funding was intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding from US lawmakers, who left for summer recess before allocating any funding to Zika research and preparedness.The mosquito-borne Zika virus has spread to more than 50 countries and territories since the outbreak began last year in Brazil. On Thursday, Governor Rick Scott said state health officials have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika, bringing the total to 25.The Obama administration in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but congressional lawmakers have been considering a much smaller sum. A bill providing $1.1 billion was blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare services, mainly in US territories like Puerto Rico.The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika. In addition, Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they said would gut clean water protections.The new bolus of funds from HHS comes on top of the $589 million in repurposed funds previously allocated for Ebola efforts. HHS has said these funds will run out at the end of August.At a press briefing in Washington, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he needs $33 million to prepare to move the first potential Zika vaccine to the second phase of human clinical trials. The first phase of that testing is expected to end in late November or December.Fauci said the health secretary has the authority to transfer 1 percent of NIH's $33 billion budget per year from one Institute to the other. He said the director of the NIH, Dr. Francis Collins will decide which existing programs the funds will be drawn from.""He will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes,"" he said.Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding needs to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate. Drugs frequently fail to realize the promise they show in early trials.""We still need about $196 million more,"" he said.Fauci said the health secretary's action was essentially one of desperation given the failure of Congress to authorize additional funding.Taking money from other research programs ""is extremely damaging to the biomedical research enterprise,"" he said. ""We're taking money away from cancer, diabetes, all those things.""Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said at the briefing that local health authorities are similarly siphoning off money from other programs.""We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,"" he said.In her letter, Burwell said the $47 million in funding for BARDA will allow the agency to enter into contracts with key partners to develop vaccines. But, she said BARDA will need an estimated $342 million in additional funding to continue its work with outside partners in the development of vaccines, diagnostics and pathogen inactivation technology used to protect the US blood supply."

Dr Death: When life-savers turned life-takers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Dr-Death-When-life-savers-turned-life-takers/articleshow/53726185.cms,"NEW DELHI: A doctor in Maharashtra who was arrested last week in connection with the murder of an anganwadi worker, later confessed to killing five more people including four women between 2003 and 2016, and burying them in his farmhouse. The 42-year-old Dr Santosh Pol+ , dubbed as 'Dr Death', is in police custody till August 19. Here are some life-savers from across the globe whose names have gone down in history for becoming life-takers:Harold ShipmanDr Harold Shipman was found responsible for at least 218 deaths by a British court. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and is perhaps the only British doctor to be successfully prosecuted for murdering his patients. He hanged himself at the age of 57.It was noticed that many of his patients died if they were left alone in a room with him. His pattern of murdering patients surfaced after he committed a grave mistake in one of his cases. After killing one of his patients, he forged her will and stated a large sum of money against his own name. The daughter of the deceased was suspicious of this sudden development and this initiated an investigation. The police raided his residence and found the typewriter which was used to rewrite the will. After his arrest, it was found that all his patients had died of a drug overdose, a lethal pattern followed by him for attaining their assets. Several other theories have been put forward as to why he killed his patients. ""Some suggest that he simply could not resist playing God, proving that he could take life as well as save it,"" says The Guardian. Jayant Mukundray PatelDr Jayant Patel, an India-born American surgeon, is known for his manslaughters and medical negligence. He was tried in Australia but was acquitted of all charges, not once but twice. There were about 87 deaths among the 1,202 patients he treated between year 2003 and 2005.Reports suggest that he used to perform unneccesary medical surgeries, operate on other doctors' patients and cause them bodily harm. The nurses were so alarmed by his conduct that they hid patients from him, reports The Independent.Dorothea WaddinghamDorothea Waddingham ran a nursing home in Nottingham. Though not a registered nurse, she started a nursing home at her residence and started taking in elderly patients for giving them medical assistance. Two of these patients were an elderly woman and her young daughter. The woman passed away under suspicious circumstances and soon after, her daughter died too. Also, there were changes in her will which included the woman's willingness to be cremated after her death, reports the Nottingham Post. Had she been cremated, this bizarre case would never have unfolded. However, the cremation required the permission of two doctors. While one immediately gave Dorothea the nod, the other doctor was suspicious about the sudden death of the mother-daughter duo and sent the bodies for an autopsy. The examination revealed that there was excessive amount of morphine in the blood of the deceased. She was convicted of murder and fraud and later hanged to death. Josef MengeleDr Josef Mengele, a Nazi doctor during the second world war was known as the ""Angel of Death"". He would stand in a white coat, with his arms outstretched, waiting for prisoners outside the Nazi concentration camps, thus receiving the nickname. He used to check these prisoners for physical fitness and those who were unfit were then sent to the gas chambers. The others were sent for bonded labour.He is also known for his notorious and harsh experiments on children, especially twins. He used to perform surgeries on children without using anaesthesia and most of them died on the operating table due to unbearable pain and torture. He operated on them for his own whims and fancies, sometimes removing their organs, sewing twins together, injecting dyes into eyeballs to change eye colour. A survivor told The International Business Times that about 1,500 pairs of twins were used in Mengele's experiments, of which only about 280 individuals survived until the liberation of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945.John Bodkin AdamsA suspected serial killer, John perhaps murdered over 160 of his patients. Of these, 132 had rewritten their wills and included himself in it. However, in 1957, he was acquitted of murder charges. Adams then resumed his medicine practice until his death. This case was responsible for many important changes to the English legal system. Newspapers were packed with stories of how he targeted elderly female patients; how he changed their wills in his favour, cut them off from their families and then killed them with lethal injections of morphine and heroin, a BBC report on the doctor says.Adams was found guilty of prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a dangerous drugs register.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope discovered this pair of lost galaxies because now they have started giving birth to new stars which made them visible from earth.The Hubble observations suggest that the galaxies, called Pisces A and B, are late bloomers because they have spent most of their existence in the Local Void, a region of the universe sparsely populated with galaxies. The Local Void is roughly 150 million light-years across.Under the steady pull of gravity from the galactic big city, the loner dwarf galaxies have at last entered a crowded region that is denser in intergalactic gas. In this gas-rich environment, star birth may have been triggered by gas raining down on the galaxies as they plow through the denser region. Another idea is that the duo may have encountered a gaseous filament, which compresses gas in the galaxies and stokes star birth. Space Telescope Science Institute's Erik Tollerud and his team determined that the objects are at the edge of a nearby filament of dense gas. Each galaxy contains only about 10 million stars.""These Hubble images may be snapshots of what present-day dwarf galaxies may have been like at earlier epochs,"" said lead researcher Tollerud. ""Studying these and other similar galaxies can provide further clues to dwarf galaxy formation and evolution.""Dwarf galaxies are the building blocks from which larger galaxies were formed billions of years ago in the early universe. Inhabiting a sparse desert of largely empty space for most of the universe's history, these two galaxies avoided that busy construction period.""These galaxies may have spent most of their history in the void,"" Tollerud explained. ""If this is true, the void environment would have slowed their evolution. Evidence for the galaxies' void address is that their hydrogen content is somewhat high relative to similar galaxies. The galaxies also are quite compact relative to the typical star-forming galaxies in our galactic neighborhood.""The dwarf galaxies are small and faint, so finding them is extremely difficult. Astronomers spotted them by using radio telescopes in a unique survey to measure the hydrogen content in our Milky Way. The observations captured thousands of small blobs of dense hydrogen gas. Most of them are gas clouds within our galaxy, but astronomers identified 30 to 50 of those blobs as possible galaxies.Pisces A is about 19 million light-years from Earth and Pisces B roughly 30 million light-years away. Based on the galaxies' locations, an analysis of the stars' colors allowed the astronomers to trace the star formation history of both galaxies. Each galaxy contains about 20 to 30 bright blue stars, a sign that they are very young, less than 100 million years old. Tollerud's team estimates that less than 100 million years ago, the galaxies doubled their star-formation rate. Eventually, the star formation may slow down again if the galaxies become satellites of a much larger galaxy.""The galaxies could even probably stop forming stars altogether, because they will stop getting new gas to make stars,"" Tollerud said. ""So they will use up their existing gas. But it's hard to tell right now exactly when that would happen, so it's a reasonable guess that the star formation will ramp up at least for a while."""
Why frogs can tell you more about the forest than tigers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Why-frogs-can-tell-you-more-about-the-forest-than-tigers/articleshow/53789150.cms,"Scientists point at frogs as environmental indicators. Studying these creatures that range in size from 1 to 20 cm, provides clues on the impact of climate changeBENGALURU: The romance of the rain has always inspired novelists, poets and musicians, but the monsoon also calls out to evolutionary biologists, who study how life evolved on earth. Scientists are heading out to record calls and document tiny species that are easiest to find in the rain â€” frogs.""It's a beautiful adventure to walk with the frogs following their calls, wait for the rain to stop and record their music,"" says Vineeth Kumar, 26, a research scholar studying amphibian acoustics at Mangalore University, who will be going to the Ghats in Dakshin Kannada district in search of frogs in a couple of weeks.Over the last 15 years, more than 150 species of frogs have been discovered in India, at least 100 of them in the Western Ghats, a Unesco World Heritage Site and one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The country has close to 400 species of amphibians. In a world where one believes there's little left to discover, scientists are still finding new species of amphibians and say there are more to uncover.""Biologists who work on mammals and birds assume there is nothing left to discover but when it comes to smaller vertebrates, people haven't surveyed the mountains systematically,"" says S P Vijayakumar of Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, whose paper on bush frogs of the Western Ghats has been published in the Proceedings of Royal Society (Biological Sciences) this week. ""We'll hear of more frog species over the next five years. The work of the last 15 years is just showing results,"" he says. His paper examines the effect of geology (mountains), ecology and climate on the way frog species diverged.Within the Ghats, which span 1,600km in five states, scientists are finding the most amphibians in Agasthyamala, Valparai, Munnar, Wayanad, Silent Valley and Kudremukh in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. About 200 species of frogs are jam-packed into this area of the Ghats and for the biologists, it's exciting to know how each is distinct from the other. ""We tend to talk a lot about biodiversity conservation in India but at the ground level we lack the vision to prioritize proper documentation of India's vast natural heritage. As we work more, surprises will continue to come,"" says S D Biju, professor at University of Delhi, whose interest in frogs was triggered 25 years ago during plant collection expeditions in the Western Ghats. ""I often stumbled upon frogs and was surprised by their striking diversity in colour, shape, size and behaviour,"" he says. Gradually, he began devoting more time to frog research and published his first findings, which said there were 100 new species of frogs to be described in the Western Ghats. ""So far, I have formally described over 90 new species, seven new genera and two new families of amphibians,"" he says.As important as species discovery is, just spotting and describing new species isn't enough, explains Kartik Shanker, currently director of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Bengaluru, who co-authored the paper with Vijayakumar. ""That's a bit like stamp-collecting,"" he says. ""We probably have 30 or 40 new species in our collections, but we are equally interested in what causes the diversity. That can provide fascinating insights into the ecology and evolution of these little-known groups as well as of these spectacular species rich regions.""Frogs are good environmental indicators or barometers as their habitat is small and their populations are at greater threat than species like tigers, which are more widespread. They're also tiny in size â€” ranging from 1cm to 20cm â€” and if something happens to their habitat, they can't move like larger creatures can. Studying them provides information about the impact of climate change at a micro level. ""Late breeding, eggs are drying out, all these are indicators of micro changes in local habitats,"" explains K V Gururaja, chief scientist at Gubbi Labs in Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, who has described 20 species. ""Small creatures give you these pointers much faster than waiting for elephants or tigers to move away. You can identify the problem before it becomes so large that it affects the larger mammals,"" he says.Discovering more species also adds value to the landscape. Frogs are ancient species dating back to the Jurassic period, probably 265 million years old. In comparison, tigers have only been around for about two million years. ""So studying frogs can help us understand the world around us,"" says Vijayakumar giving the example of the purple pignose frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis), which was described by Biju in the early 2000s in the Western Ghats in Kerala. ""Its closest sister is in the Seychelles,"" says Vijayakumar, ""that can tell us something about the way land masses broke up and how species diverged.""Between the 1800s and 1900s, there were quite a few discoveries of amphibians, but things quietened down for the next 50 to 60 years. One scientist, C R Narayana Rao from Bangalore Central College published a paper in 1937 detailing 18 new species, and many of the colonial explorers documented species. ""Post-Independence though, the push was on applied sciences and industrialisation, and natural history took a backseat,"" says Gururaja. ""Plus, of course, the frog is not a charismatic species. People usually go 'eeks!' when they see a frog."" he says.Over the last 15 years though, scientists have started exploring much more, looking at less-visible species. ""Earlier, where the road ended, the search would end,"" says Gururaja. ""Now people are willing to splash through the mud, during the monsoon, at night... maybe it's also because scientists are now physically fitter and willing to get their feet dirty,"" he says.  New technology and tools have also made identifying species precisely and spotting differences in characteristics easier. ""Modern methods help us combine molecular genetics, field ecology and modelling, which can help tell apart species that conventional methods could not,"" says Shanker, who is developing an amphibian and reptile database with Vijayakumar. ""Sometimes the species look alike but their calls and DNA are different, just because they've been sitting on different peaks for years, got isolated, and have evolved separately.""Habitat destruction and fragmentation are the major threats to amphibians. Vijayakumar reckons the discovery of frogs will taper off after a while as more species are identified and scientists will move on to lizards, snakes and finally even invertebrates. ""We may even lose some before we discover them,"" says Vijayakumar, who started work on bush frogs in 2008. ""I'll probably have to walk these hills all my life and I still won't discover all they hold.""  The grooming of citizen scientists K V Gururaja of Gubbi Labs in IISc has been organizing workshops, called Frogwatch, from 2012 to train volunteers to document species in their backyards. Volunteers spend about four days in Bisle near Sakaleshpura every June, learning what to look for and how to keep notes and record calls. The workshop is a mix of classroom lessons, training and field exploration. Volunteers upload their observations on Frogwatch, a biodiversity portal. ""It's an online reporting mechanism for amphibian spotting. After 10 years, you can see a crowdsourced map that gives you the population of frogs in the country,"" he says, adding that just the handful of experts will not be able to describe all the frogs by themselves. Citizen scientists can be people who flag off unusual observations and biologists can do the rigorous work later to identify the species. ""We need more curious people to start observing the world around them, people who are willing to walk in mud and get bitten by leeches,"" he says."

Edible milk-based wrapping to cut plastic waste,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Edible-milk-based-wrapping-to-cut-plastic-waste/articleshow/53807461.cms,"WASHINGTON: US scientists are developing an environment-friendly edible packaging film made of milk proteins that may help prevent food spoilage and reduce plastic waste.Made out of milk protein, the wrapping material could be on the shelves within three years, researchers said.Most foods such as meats, breads, cheeses and snacks come wrapped in plastic packaging. Not only does this create a lot of non-recyclable, non-biodegradable waste, but thin plastic films are not good at preventing spoilage, researchers said.Some plastics are also suspected of leaching potentially harmful compounds into food, they said.""The protein-based films are powerful oxygen blockers that help prevent food spoilage. When used in packaging, they could prevent food waste during distribution along the food chain,"" said Peggy Tomasula from US Department of Agriculture.Current food packaging is mainly petroleum-based, which is not sustainable. It also does not degrade, creating tonnes of plastic waste that sits in landfills for years.To create an all-around better packaging solution, researchers are developing an environmentally friendly film made of the milk protein casein.These casein-based films are up to 500 times better than plastics at keeping oxygen away from food and, because they are derived from milk, are biodegradable, sustainable and edible.Some commercially available edible packaging varieties are already available, but these are made of starch, which is more porous and allows oxygen to seep through its microholes.The milk-based packaging, however, has smaller pores and can thus create a tighter network that keeps oxygen out.In addition to being used as plastic pouches and wraps, this casein coating could be sprayed onto food, such as cereal flakes or bars. Right now, cereals keep their crunch in milk due to a sugar coating, researchers said.Instead of all that sugar, manufacturers could spray on casein-protein coatings to prevent soggy cereal. The spray also could line pizza or other food boxes to keep the grease from staining the packaging, or to serve as a lamination step for paper or cardboard food boxes or plastic pouches, they said."
Flooded canyons found on Saturn's moon Titan: Nasa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Flooded-canyons-found-on-Saturns-moon-Titan-Nasa/articleshow/53649010.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa's Cassini spacecraft has discovered steep-sided canyons, hundreds of meters deep, on Saturn's moon Titan that are flooded with liquid hydrocarbons.The finding represents the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid-filled channels on Titan, as well as the first observation of the deep canyons, Nasa said.Scientists analysed Cassini data from a close pass the spacecraft made over Titan in May 2013. During the flyby, Cassini's radar instrument focused on channels that branch out from the large, northern sea Ligeia Mare.The observations show that the channels - in particular, a network of them named Vid Flumina - are narrow canyons, generally less than a kilometre wide, with slopes steeper than 40 degrees. The canyons also are quite deep - those measured are 240 to 570 metres from top to bottom.The branching channels appear dark in radar images, much like Titan's methane-rich seas.This suggested that the channels might also be filled with liquid, but a direct detection had not been made until now.Previously, it was not clear if the dark material was liquid or merely saturated sediment - which at Titan's frigid temperatures would be made of ice, not rock.Cassini's radar was used as an altimeter, sending pings of radio waves to the moon's surface to measure the height of features there.The researchers combined the altimetry data with previous radar images of the region to make their discovery.The radar instrument observed a glint, indicating an extremely smooth surface like that observed from Titan's hydrocarbon seas.The timing of radar echoes, as they bounced off the canyons' edges and floors, provided a measure of their depths.The presence of such deep cuts in the landscape indicates that the process that created them was active for a long time or eroded down faster than other areas on Titan's surface.The researchers' proposed scenarios include uplift of the terrain and changes in sea level, or perhaps both.""It's likely that a combination of these forces contributed to the formation of the deep canyons, but at present it's not clear to what degree each was involved,"" said Valerio Poggiali, Cassini radar team associate from the University of Rome and lead author of the study.Earthly examples of both of these types of canyon-carving processes are found along the Colorado River in Arizona.An example of uplift powering erosion is the Grand Canyon, where the terrain's rising altitude caused the river to cut deeply downward into the landscape over the course of several million years.""Earth is warm and rocky, with rivers of water, while Titan is cold and icy, with rivers of methane. And yet it's remarkable that we find such similar features on both worlds,"" said Alex Hayes, from Cornell University.The finding was published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters."
China to conduct world's first gene editing trial on humans,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/China-to-conduct-worlds-first-gene-editing-trial-on-humans/articleshow/53531017.cms,"BEIJING: Chinese scientists are set to perform the world's first genetic editing trial on human beings this month. The idea behind using this controversial technique on cancer patients at a hospital in Chengdu city, is to find a cure for lung cancer, scientists said. The trial will cover 10 patients with lung cancer. It will be conducted by a set of oncologists who will attempt to selectively edit genome parts and replace them with new DNA stretches. The oncologists will inject patients with cells modified using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique. ""We plan to select ten volunteers, all advanced lung cancer patients who have undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other types of treatment. We received a lot of applications and are now busy screening and drawing up our final list,"" said Lu You, director of West China Hospital of Sichuan University in Chengdu, where the trial will be conducted. The trial received ethical approval from the hospital's review board on July 6, he said.Gene editing is disallowed in most countries because of fears that it can lead to dangerous consequences as scientists try to produce ""designer babies"" with extremely dangerous mental and behavioural traits. ""This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalization of (genetically modified) babies,"" David King of advocacy group Human Genetics Alert said recently.On the other hand, a section of scientists see it as an opportunity to find cures and even avoid production of babies with inherited diseases. The US journal Science named CRISPR as the ""2015 Breakthrough of the Year"".The move comes in the midst of a controversy involving a Chinese scientist, Han Chunyu, who claimed to have found an alternative and more effective gene editing technique. His findings have been challenged by other scientists who say they cannot be replicated in separate experiments. The Chendu institution would use the technique called CRISPR, which stands for ""clustered regularly inter-spaced short palindromic repeats"". Cas9 is an enzyme that can edit DNA, allowing the alteration of genetic patterns by genome modification. CRISPR is a collection of DNA sequences that direct Cas9 where to cut and paste.In the Chendu trials, the doctors will extract T-cells, a type of immune cell, from the patient's blood. They will then try to separate the gene that encodes the PD-1 protein, which normally limits the cell's capacity to launch an immune response. The edited cells will be multiplied in the lab before being reintroduced to the patients."
Are black holes 'back doors' to other parts of universe?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Are-black-holes-back-doors-to-other-parts-of-universe/articleshow/53596850.cms,"LONDON: Black holes may be a portal that can transfer matter to another part of the universe, rather than destroying it, a new study has claimed.One of the biggest problems when studying black holes is that the laws of physics as we know them cease to apply in their deepest regions.Large quantities of matter and energy concentrate in an infinitely small space, the gravitational singularity, where space-time curves towards infinity and all matter is destroyed.However, a new study at the Institute of Corpuscular Physics (IFIC) in Spain suggests that matter might in fact survive its foray into these space objects and come out the other side.Scientists propose considering the singularity as if it were an imperfection in the geometric structure of space-time. By doing so they resolve the problem of the infinite, space-deforming gravitational pull.""Black holes are a theoretical laboratory for trying out new ideas about gravity,"" said Gonzalo Olmo, a researcher at the University of Valencia (UV) in Spain.Specifically, in this work he has applied geometric structures similar to those of a crystal or graphene layer, not typically used to describe black holes, since these geometries better match what happens inside a black hole.""Just as crystals have imperfections in their microscopic structure, the central region of a black hole can be interpreted as an anomaly in space-time, which requires new geometric elements in order to be able to describe them more precisely,"" said Olmo.Using these new geometries, the researchers obtained a description of black holes whereby the centre point becomes a very small spherical surface.This surface is interpreted as the existence of a wormhole within the black hole.""In the first instance we resolve the problem of the singularity, since there is a door at the centre of the black hole, the wormhole, through which space and time can continue,"" Olmo said.The wormhole predicted by the equations is smaller than an atomic nucleus, but gets bigger with the charge stored in the black hole.So, a hypothetical traveller entering a black hole of this kind would be stretched to the extreme, or ""spaghettified,"" and would be able to enter the wormhole. Upon exiting they would be compacted back to their normal size.Seen from outside, these forces of stretching and compaction would seem infinite, but the traveller himself, living it first-hand, would experience only extremely intense, and not infinite, forces.The model proposed by the researchers posits that matter would not be lost inside the singularity, but rather would be expelled out from the other side through the wormhole at its centre to another region of the universe.The study was published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity."

Deficiency or excess of this hormone can create problems in women's life like early puberty or delayed puberty and abnormal uterine bleeding. In the reproductive years also it has important role to play in conception.Estrogen decreases to great extent during and after menopause which can lead to crippling problems of osteoporosis which is responsible for fractures in women.

Chemicals may be causing dip in dog fertlity,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Chemicals-may-be-causing-dip-in-dog-fertlity/articleshow/53617457.cms,"In a startling and ominous finding, a study has found that sperm quality in dogs has steadily declined over the past 26 years and this could have been caused by environmental contaminants, including chemicals found in pet foods.This could have bearing on humans as dogs and humans closely share similar environments. As 'man's best friend' and closest companion animal, the researchers believe that the latest results may offer a new piece of the puzzle over the reported significant decline in human semen quality - a controversial subject which scientists continue to debate.Led by researchers at The University of Nottingham, the study is published in the academic journal Scientific Reports.""This is the first time that such a decline in male fertility has been reported in the dog and we believe this is due to environmental contaminants, some of which we have detected in dog food and in the sperm and testes of the animals themselves,"" said Dr Richard Lea, of the university's School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, who led the research.""While further research is needed to conclusively demonstrate a link, the dog may indeed be a sentinel for humans - it shares the same environment, exhibits the same range of diseases, many with the same frequency and responds in a similar way to therapies.""The work centred on five specific breeds of dogs - Labrador retriever, golden retriever, curly coat retriever, border collie and German shepherd -- with between 42 and 97 dogs studied every year.Semen was collected from the dogs and analysed to assess the percentage of sperm that showed a normal forward progressive pattern of motility and that appeared normal under a microscope (morphology).Over the 26 years of the study, they found a striking decrease in the percentage of normal motile sperm. Between 1988 and 1998, sperm motility declined by 2.5 per cent per year and following a short period when stud dogs of compromised fertility were retired from the study, sperm motility from 2002 to 2014 continued to decline at a rate of 1.2% per year.Sperm collected from the same breeding population of dogs, and testes recovered from dogs undergoing routine castration, were found to contain environmental contaminants at concentrations able to disrupt sperm motility and viability when tested.The same chemicals that disrupted sperm quality, were also discovered in a range of commercially available dog foods - including brands specifically marketed for puppies.Dr Lea added: ""We looked at other factors which may also play a part, for example, some genetic conditions do have an impact on fertility. However, we discounted that because 26 years is simply too rapid a decline to be associated with a genetic problem."""
Scientists to unveil new Earth-like planet: Report,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Scientists-to-unveil-new-Earth-like-planet-Report/articleshow/53676330.cms,"BERLIN: Scientists are preparing to unveil a new planet in our galactic neighbourhood which is ""believed to be Earth-like"" and orbits its star at a distance that could favour life, German weekly Der Spiegel reported today.The exoplanet orbits a well-investigated star called Proxima Centauri, part of the Alpha Centauri star system, the magazine said, quoting anonymous sources.""The still nameless planet is believed to be Earth-like and orbits at a distance to Proxima Centauri that could allow it to have liquid water on its surface, an important requirement for the emergence of life,"" said the magazine.""Never before have scientists discovered a second Earth that is so close by,"" it said, adding that the European Southern Observatory (ESO) will announce the finding at the end of August.The report gave no further details.Contacted by AFP, ESO spokesman Richard Hook said he is aware of the report, but refused to confirm or deny it. ""We are not making any comment,"" he said.NASA has announced the discovery of new planets in the past, but most of those worlds were either too hot or too cold to host water in liquid form, or were made of gas, like our Jupiter and Neptune, rather than of rock, like Earth or Mars.Last year, the US space agency unveiled an exoplanet that it described as Earth's ""closest-twin"".Named Kepler 452b, the planet is about 60 percent larger than Earth and could have active volcanoes, oceans, sunshine like ours, twice as much gravity and a year that lasts 385 days.But at a distance of 1,400 light-years away, humankind has little hope of reaching this Earth-twin any time soon.In comparison, the exoplanet orbiting Proxima Centauri, if confirmed, is just 4.24 light-years away.This is a mere stepping stone in relation to the scale of the Universe but still too far away for humans to reach in present-generation chemical rockets.According to NASA's Godard Space Center's website, it lies 39,900,000,000,000 kilometres away, or 271,000 times the distance of Earth to the Sun.Proxima Centauri, discovered in 1915, is one of three stars in the Alpha Centauri system, a constellation mainly visible from the southern hemisphere."

The majority of research is done with the assumption that men and women are biologically the same,"" said Clegg.One reason females are excluded from studies, she said, is that across the menstrual cycle there are fluctuations in hormones such as estrogens and progesterone, in essence creating a different hormonal milieu or profile depending on the phase of cycle, which may potentially impact the research.Often overlooked in male-only studies, these sex hormones are implicated in all biological processes, including sensitivity to fatty acids, or the ability to metabolise simple sugars, she said.These differences have implications for all clinical trials, whether they are testing the effects of a drug or a body's ability to tolerate an organ transplant.""It is important to remember that chromosomal differences also exist between the sexes,"" said Clegg.There is little research examining whether drugs behave differently in the presence of an XX chromosome as opposed to an XY chromosome.Even genome-wide studies often do not take chromosomes into account, even though sex chromosomes are an integral piece of an individual's genomic makeup.""It would be great if there were drugs that were specifically tested and dosed based on sex,"" said Clegg.""With the goal of personalised medicine, it is important to begin to address and focus on sex as a biological variable,"" she said.The findings were published in the journal Cell Metabolism."
NASA's Curiosity rover showcases buttes and mesas on Red Planet,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/NASAs-Curiosity-rover-showcases-buttes-and-mesas-on-Red-Planet/articleshow/53783727.cms,"WASHINGTON: NASA's Curiosity rover has captured a 360-degree view of eroded mesas and buttes on Mars.The rover used its Mast Camera (Mastcam) to capture dozens of component images of this scene on August 5 this year four years after landing inside Gale Crater, the US space agency said in a statement on Friday.The mesas and buttes have a relatively flat foreground, part of a geological layer called the Murray formation, which formed from lakebed mud deposits.The buttes and mesas rising above this surface are eroded remnants of ancient sandstone that originated when winds deposited sand after lower Mount Sharp had formed, the statement added.Curiosity closely examined that layer, the Stimson formation, during the first half of 2016 while crossing a feature called ""Naukluft Plateau"" between two exposures of the Murray formation.The buttes and mesas of Murray Buttes are capped by material that is relatively resistant to erosion, just as is the case with many similarly shaped buttes and mesas on Earth.The informal naming honors Bruce Murray (1931-2013), a Caltech planetary scientist and director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.Early in its mission on Mars, Curiosity accomplished its main goal when it found and examined an ancient habitable environment.In an extended mission, the rover is examining successively younger layers as it climbs the lower part of Mount Sharp.A key goal is to learn how freshwater lake conditions, which would have been favorable for microbes billions of years ago if Mars has ever had life, evolved into harsher, arid conditions much less suited to supporting life. The mission is also monitoring the modern environment of Mars.These findings have been addressing high-priority goals for planetary science and further aid NASA's preparations for a human mission to the Red Planet, NASA said."

They are part of the unique Protecting Ice Memory project, which is aimed at drawing out long tubes of ice from glaciers for their preservation in Antarctica. The purpose is to build the world's first library of ice archives extracted from glaciers which are threatened by global warming.""In the coming decades, or even centuries, this ice archive will be invaluable - be it for entirely unprecedented scientific discoveries or for understanding local changes in the environment,"" said Jean Jouzel, climatologist and Vice-Chair of the IPCC, 2002-2015.Three ice cores, each measuring 130 meters in length, will be extracted and lowered into the valley by helicopter before being transported to the LGGE in Grenoble, while maintaining a strict cold chain throughout the process. One core will be analysed in 2019 to begin building a database available to the entire world scientific community. The other two will be transported by ship before being transferred onto tracked vehicles on the high plateaus of Antarctica in 2020 for storage at the Concordia station, which is run by French and Italian scientists. The long-term plan is to have dozens of ice core archives stored in a snow cave at -54Â°C , which is the most reliable and natural freezer in the world.The Col du Dome glacier represents the first step in this major project, originally launched in 2015 by the LGGE, Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Italy) and the CNR (Italian National Research Council), backed by the Universite Grenoble Alpes Foundation. A second, longer and more complex operation will be carried out in 2017 on the Illimani glacier in the Bolivian Andes. A number of other countries are already candidates to join this project and protect the memory of the glaciers to which they have access: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Brazil, the United States, Russia, China, Nepal and Canada.The idea to create this project was born when scientists observed a rise in temperatures on several glaciers. At ten-year intervals, the temperature near to the glaciers on the Col du Dome and Illimani in the Andes has risen between 1.5Â° and 2Â°. At the current rate, their surface will undergo systematic melting over the summer in the next few years and decades. Due to this melting and the percolation of meltwater through the underlying layers of snow, these are unique pages in the history of our environment which will be lost forever.""We are the only community of scientists working on climate to see a chunk of its archives disappearing. We urgently need to build this heritage for the future, much like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault kept on the island of Spitsbergen,"" explains Jerome Chappellaz, the French project initiator from CNRS. ""Our generation of scientists, which bears witness to global warming, has a particular responsibility to future generations. That is why we will be donating these ice samples from the world's most fragile glaciers to the scientific community of the decades and centuries to come, when these glaciers would have disappeared or lost their data quality,"" adds Carlo Barbante, the Italian project initiator from Ca' Foscari University of Venice."
Novel device lets surgeons feel what they can't touch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Novel-device-lets-surgeons-feel-what-they-cant-touch/articleshow/53506436.cms,"TOKYO: Researchers have designed a small vibrating device that can be attached to any existing hand-held surgical tool to improve a surgeon's sensitivity to different shapes and textures inside the patient's body.During laparoscopic surgeries, surgeons rely on long, thin, metal tools to explore their patients' bodies as they can no longer use their fingers to directly touch patients to sense essential information about their organs.When attached to a surgeon's favourite surgical tool, the vibrator called PZT Actuator begins to vibrate in the surgeon's palm at a constant rate.In the study, volunteers were blindfolded and asked to use surgical forceps with the PZT Actuator attached to the handle to identify different textures of sandpaper and find a small Styrofoam ball inside a cup filled with silicone.These tests mimic detecting tissue texture and identifying a solid tumour.The results of these tests and other analysis revealed that there is a range of vibration intensity that significantly improves anyone's sensitivity, the researchers said.The tool does not need to be fine-tuned to each user's unique sense of touch, meaning the PZT Actuator is robust and simple to use.The device could be used instantly, without requiring extra training for doctors.Further, the PZT Actuator also remains safe for patients because the device is only on the handles of the surgeon's tools, not inside the patient's body.The vibrations are so subtle that they do not shake the tool. The electrical power supply is also safe for doctors and patients.However, this constant, uniform vibration enhances the surgeon's sensitivity to other, irregular sensations.The natural variations of touching different tissues with a metal tool may normally be too subtle for the surgeon to detect, but the constant vibrations supplied by the PZT Actuator boosts the sensation to a noticeable level.""Typical medical tools obtain information about the patient's condition. There are very few devices that aim to enhance the doctor's skill,"" said lead author Yuichi Kurita, Associate Professor at Hiroshima University in Japan.""Our next set of experiments will confirm the usefulness of the PZT Actuator in surgical situations. Before we can give this tool to surgeons, we must also develop a method to maintain good hygiene of the device so it is always safe for patients,"" Kurita added."

This follows the inclusion of cardiac stents in the National List of Essential Medicines, prepared by the health ministry. In the next step, drug pricing regulator NPPA is expected to announce ceiling prices to bring these exorbitantly-priced medical devices under price control, official sources say, adding the final modalities are being worked out.A core committee had recommended earlier that cardiac stents be included in the national list of essential medicinesFollowing a petition earlier this year, the Delhi High Court had directed the government to monitor prices of stents in the market. Recently, a Rajya Sabha committee which met in Bangalore has also recommended a mechanism to check exorbitant prices of cardiac stents to safeguard patient's interest, while promoting cost effectiveness in industry.Over the past year, there have been several complaints about overcharging, with regulators investigating cases where patients have coughed up almost four to five times the landed cost (price at which these are imported) for devices like cardiac stents. These are sold with mark-ups as high as 250-400%, resulting in a huge gap between the imported price and price charged to patients. Worse, medical devices like cardiac stents do not carry the MRP tag on individual packs, bringing in ambiguity and making it easier for hospitals to overcharge patients.  Efforts to bring down prices of medical devices, including stents, have failed till now as the government has not been able to reach a consensus, with some departments having opposed the move saying it may impede potential foreign investment."
Juno set to reach farthest point in its Jupiter orbit,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Juno-set-to-reach-farthest-point-in-its-Jupiter-orbit/articleshow/53469539.cms,"NEW YORK: Five years after departing from Earth, NASA's Juno spacecraft is all set to reach the farthest point in its orbit of Jupiter on Sunday to ""get the science"" of the giant planet with a mass two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in our solar system combined.Known as ""apojove"", the orbit is nearly 8.1 million km from Jupiter, and after this point the gravitational grip of solar system's largest planet on Juno will cause the spacecraft to begin falling back toward it for another pass, NASA said on Friday.""For five years we have been focused on getting to Jupiter. Now we are there, and we are concentrating on beginning dozens of flybys of Jupiter to get the science we are after,"" said Scott Bolton, Juno's Principal Investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.Launched on August 5, 2011, Juno took a long, looping path around the inner solar system to set up an Earth flyby, in which our planet's gravity flung the spinning probe onward toward Jupiter.Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4 and is currently executing the first of two long orbits prior to beginning its science mission.The spacecraft's science instruments were turned off during orbit insertion to simplify spacecraft operations during the flawless manoeuvre that allowed Jupiter's gravity to capture Juno into the first of two 53.4-day-long orbits, referred to as capture orbits.Following the capture of orbits, Juno will fire its engine once more to shorten its orbital period to 14 days and begin its science mission.But before that happens, on August 27, Juno must finish its first lap around Jupiter, with a finish line that represents the mission's closest pass over the gas giant. During the encounter, Juno will skim past Jupiter at a mere 4,200 km above the cloud tops.""We are in an excellent state of health, with the spacecraft and all the instruments fully checked out and ready for our first up-close look at Jupiter,"" said Rick Nybakken, Juno Project Manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.With its powerful suite of science instruments, Juno will probe Jupiter's deep structure, atmospheric circulation and the high-energy physics of its magnetic environment."

New rare form of hereditary colon cancer identified,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-rare-form-of-hereditary-colon-cancer-identified/articleshow/53446752.cms,"LONDON: Researchers have discovered that mutation in a gene can led to a form of hereditary colon cancer which was not identified earlier.The researchers discovered genetic changes in the MSH3 gene in patients and identified a new form of colon cancer.""The knowledge about molecular mechanisms which lead to cancer is also a precondition for the development of new targeted drugs,"" said Stefan Aretz from University of Bonn Hospital in Germany.The formation of large numbers of polyps in the colon has a high probability of developing into colon cancer, if left untreated.Colon polyps form like mushroom-shaped growths from the mucosa and are several millimeters to several centimetres in size.They are benign and generally do not cause any symptoms - however, they can turn into malignant tumours (colon cancer).Physicians refer to the development of a large number of polyps in the colon as ""polyposis."" Scientists have already discovered several genes associated with a polyposis.""However, about one-third of families affected by the disease do not have any abnormalities in these genes,"" Aretz said.Therefore, there would have to be even more genes involved in the formation of polyps in the colon.Together with pathologists from the University Hospital Bonn, scientists from the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven (USA), and the Frankfurt University Hospital,The team of US and German researchers working with Aretz investigated the genetic material (DNA) of more than 100 polyposis patients using blood samples.In each patient, all of the about 20,000 protein-coding genes known were simultaneously examined.In this process, the scientists filtered the rare, possibly relevant genetic changes out of the gigantic quantity of data, like the proverbial needle in a haystack.In two patients, genetic changes (mutations) were discovered in the MSH3 gene on chromosome five, showed the findings published in the American Journal of Human Genetics.The researchers believe that by investigating the MSH3 gene, a clear diagnosis can be made prospectively in some other, previously unexplained polyposis cases. Afterwards, healthy persons at risk in the family can be tested for the mutations."
Protein that boosts growth of damaged muscle tissue identified,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Protein-that-boosts-growth-of-damaged-muscle-tissue-identified/articleshow/53300042.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have identified a key protein that can boost the growth of damaged muscle tissue, an advance that may lead to treatments for muscle degeneration caused by old age and diseases such as muscular dystrophy.Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University found that the protein called integrin is present on the stem cell surface and used by stem cells to interact with, or ""sense"" their surroundings.How stem cells sense their surroundings, also known as the stem cell ""niche,"" affects how they live and last for regeneration, researchers said.The presence of the protein beta one-integrin was shown to help promote the transformation of those undifferentiated stem cells into muscle after the tissue has degraded, and improve regenerated muscle fibre growth as much as 50 per cent.While the presence of beta one-integrin in adult stem cells is apparent, its role in these cells has not been examined, especially its influence on the biochemical signals promoting stem cell growth, researchers said.The experiment shows that beta one-integrin - one of 28 types of integrin - maintains a link between the stem cell and its environment, and interacts biochemically with a growth factor called fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to promote stem cell growth and restoration after muscle tissue injury.Aged stem cells do not respond to FGF, and the results also show that beta one-integrin restores aged stem cell's ability to respond to FGF to grow and improve muscle regeneration.By tracking an array of proteins inside the stem cells, researchers tested the effects of removing beta one-integrin from the stem cell.This is based on the understanding that the activities of stem cells are dependent on their environment and supported by the proteins found there.""If we take out beta one-integrin, all these other proteins are gone,"" said Chen-Ming Fan, a professor at the Carnegie Institution for Science.Why that is the case is not clear, but the experiment showed that without beta one-integrin, stem cells could not sustain growth after muscle tissue injury.By examining beta one-integrin molecules and the array of proteins that they used to track stem cell activity in aged muscles, researchers found that all of these proteins looked like they had been removed from aged stem cells.They injected an antibody to boost beta one-integrin function into aged muscles to test whether this treatment would enhance muscle regeneration.Measurements of muscle fibre growth with and without boosting the function of beta one-integrin showed that the protein led to as much as 50 per cent more regeneration in cases of injury in aged mice.When the same beta one-integrin function-boosting strategy was applied to mice with muscular dystrophy, the muscle was able to increase strength by about 35 per cent.The findings appear in the journal Nature Medicine."
"Sleep next to a chicken, avoid malaria",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Sleep-next-to-a-chicken-avoid-malaria/articleshow/53330402.cms,"Scientists have come up with a surprising way to avoid getting malaria - sleeping with a chicken next to the bed.  A study in Ethiopia found that while mosquitoes have a taste for human blood, they are repelled by the smell of chickens.Testing the blood in mosquitoes that had recently fed, researchers from Sweden and Ethiopia, found just one out of nearly 1,200 had bitten a chicken with people and cattle seeming to bear the brunt of the insects' attentions.Malaria is spread mainly by mosquitoes. One of the researchers, Professor Rickard Ignell, of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, said: ""We were surprised to find that malaria mosquitoes are repelled by the odours emitted by chickens. ""This study shows for the first time that malaria mosquitoes actively avoid feeding on certain animal species, and that this behaviour is regulated through odour cues."" The researchers, including academics from Addis Ababa University, took blood samples from mosquitoes that had just fed indoors and outdoors.Cattle were the most fed upon animal outdoors with 63% of mosquitoes being found to have sucked their blood. Twenty per cent had sucked human blood with five per cent feeding on goats and 2.6% on sheep. The researchers found just one mosquito with chicken blood. The researchers identified four ""chicken-specific compounds"" - isobutyl butyrate, naphthalene, hexadecane and trans-limonene - found in their feathers that appeared to have a repellent effect. They also said the chicken feathers posed a physical barrier to mosquitoes and noted the birds ""will actively feed on mosquitoes"". Mosquito traps were set up in 11 homes for 11 days with a volunteer agreeing to sleep under an untreated bed net nearby. Significantly fewer mosquitoes were caught in traps baited with the chicken compounds. the independent"

Robots just as good as human surgeons: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Robots-just-as-good-as-human-surgeons-Study/articleshow/53442257.cms,"NEW DELHI: Robots can be as good as human surgeons, a landmark Australian trial has found after comparing the advanced technology with traditional open surgery.  Findings of the comprehensive trial, conducted on men diagnosed with prostate cancer, showed those whose glands were removed through robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy were doing just as well after three months as those who underwent traditional open surgery. In fact, patients who were operated by a machine or robot lost far less blood as compared to those under traditional surgery - a factor very crucial in such operations. Moreover, patients who had open surgery spent more time in hospital and experienced more pain doing day to day activities a week after the operation, according to the study.The study based on the trial has been published in The Lancet and the British Medical Journal. Doctors and surgeons in India say robotic surgery is much advanced and have multiple benefits as compared to traditional open operation. According to Dr Ashish Sabharwal, robotic prostate surgeon at New Delhi's Apollo Hospital, ""Complications of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction are significantly reduced after robotic surgery. The recovery is also faster in such cases. We usually discharge a patient after two days of robotic surgery, whereas hospital stay of around five to six days is required in case of open surgery,"" Dr Sabharwal said.  Though robots are now used for various other cancer surgeries like cervical cancer, kidney and lung cancer, surgeons say it is most useful in prostate cancer.  Though robotic surgery has been in use worldwide since 2000 and has also ben available in India over the last seven years, it has been surrounded by doubts and controversies mainly because of its high cost.  According to Dr Sabharwal, a robotic prostate surgery in India costs around Rs 3.5 lakhs, whereas open surgery can be conducted for Rs 1.5-2 lakhs. ""However, since the hospital stay is lesser in case of robotic surgery, part of the cost is compensated,"" he said.  In robotic surgery, a high magnification 3D camera allows the surgeon a view inside the patient's body through a keyhole incision. The camera is attached to one of four arms on the machine, whereas the other three hold other surgical instruments needed for the operation."
Novel method can scale up stem cell production,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Novel-method-can-scale-up-stem-cell-production/articleshow/53227004.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have found a new method of creating human stem cells which could solve the big problem of the large-scale production needed to fully realise the potential of these remarkable cells for understanding and treating disease.The discovery has been made by a team of scientists at the University of Nottingham in Britain, Uppsala University and GE Healthcare in Sweden.""By using a protein derived from human blood called Inter-alpha inhibitor, we have grown human pluripotent stem cells in a minimal medium without the need for costly and time-consuming biological substrates,"" said first author Sara Pijuan-Galito from Uppsala University.Inter-alpha inhibitor is found in human blood at high concentrations, and is currently a by-product of standard drug purification schemes.""The protein can make stem cells attach on unmodified tissue culture plastic, and improve survival of the stem cells in harsh conditions,"" Pijuan-Galito said.""It is the first stem cell culture method that does not require a pre-treated biological substrate for attachment, and therefore, is more cost and time-efficient and paves the way for easier and cheaper large-scale production,"" Pijuan-Galito explained.Human pluripotent stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the unique potential to develop into all the different types of cells in the body.With applications in disease modelling, drug screening, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, there is already an enormous demand for these cells, which will only grow as their use in the clinic and by the pharmaceutical industry increases.However, production of stem cells at the scale required for optimal application in modern healthcare is currently not feasible because available culture methods are either too expensive, or reliant on substances that would not be safe for clinical use in humans.The new research, published in the journal Nature Communications, could lead to quicker and cheaper large scale industrial production.The work was started at Uppsala University in Sweden, and the first author, Dr Sara Pijuan-Galita, is now continuing her work as a Swedish Research Council Research Fellow at Nottingham. Sara said:""This new method has the potential to save time and money in large-scale and high-throughput cultures, and be highly valuable for both basic research and commercial applications,"" Cecilia Anneren, who has a joint position at Uppsala University and at GE Healthcare in Uppsala, said."
Einstein will continue to be relevant...,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Einstein-will-continue-to-be-relevant-/articleshow/53434554.cms,"On Friday, he will be singing Herman Hupfeld's 'As time goes by', which gained popularity after it was used in Casablanca, a decade later in 1942. He'll be singing it for the for students in St Joseph's College and he says he isn't singing it because it was in Casablanca, but because the prelude to the song is about (Albert) Einstein. Dr Clifford Will, an expert on the General Theory of Relativity and someone who's been on multiple advisory committees in the US, including some of Nasa's is in Bengaluru to conduct a 2-week course for graduate students aimed at helping them be part of the LIGO-India project, one of India's biggest science endeavoursâ€”what with the International project having successfully detected two Gravitational Waves in quick succession, after 100 years, with considerable Indian contribution.In an exclusive chat with TOI, Will spoke on Einstein being to Physics what Shakespeare is to English, and on the need for outreach in countries like India, among other things. Excerpts: Q: Your are here to give a two-week course on General Theory of Relativity, in which Einstein mentions Gravitational Waves, can you elaborate?A: The LIGO project has detected and India has been on board. When the India project comes up, there will be a battery of scientists, by 2020. A scientific expertise in the theory of relativity. I am here to give lectures on the fundamentals of Gravitational Waves, they've been happening at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences. The lecture at St Joseph's is a public lecture, and I will be singing 'As time goes by'. The nature of that lecture is different.Q: Your book, 'Was Einstein Right?"" first published in 1986 is considered one of the good works. Your thoughts of the scientific community actually finding the waves & what it may mean in the future...A: It is difficult to predict how this will impact future astrophysics. But what we can see is that it has already caused a huge spark of interest by astrophysicists. I must say that when they found the waves, proving Einstein right, I thought it came from an unexpected source (the black holes). I thought it would be neutron stars.Q: For the first decade and more, the LIGO project had nothing to show but curiosity. But what it found was game-changing. How important are such projects?A: It is important for all nations to encourage science based on curiosity, especially for countries like India, which has a lot of needs and concerns. Basic science is key. Not only does it help have disruptive science that will deal with a lot of these problems for the future, but it will also have other incentives. Look at the LIGO-India, there was a huge convergence of scientists. Also, there was convergence of a lot of technology and a lot of engineers were on board too.Q: The NSF, which backed LIGO, or Nasa have huge outreach programmes, something that is lacking in India and a few other countries...A: It was not that way even in the US. Even Carl Sagan (an American cosmologist) was criticised for spending so much time engaging with the public. He was asked to do science. But today any proposal to the NSF needs to have details about what our plans for public outreach are. It is important to take science to the people, not only to show what we are doing and help them understand science but to also encourage rational thinking and to kill superstition and bias.Q: Finally, will Einstein continue to survive?A: He is extremely relevant and he will continue to be.

Zika virus antibodies identified in mice,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Zika-virus-antibodies-identified-in-mice/articleshow/53429174.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have identified six Zika virus antibodies in mice, an advancement that may pave the way for a vaccine, better diagnostic tests and possibly new therapies for the mosquito-borne virus.The researchers conducted experiments in mice and identified the antibodies, including four that neutralise African, Asian and American strains of Zika virus.The research could inform prophylactic treatment approaches for pregnant women at risk of Zika virus infection.The team headed by Michael S Diamond and Daved H Fremont, of Washington University School of Medicine also developed atomic-level X-ray crystal structure images showing four of the antibodies in complex with three distinct regions (epitopes) of a key Zika protein.Structural information about antibody-epitope interactions is useful to vaccine developers because it provides a pathway for designing vaccines that can induce antibodies directed towards the critical epitopes.The researchers also found that two of the newly identified Zika antibodies could protect mice from Zika infection.Currently there are no specific treatments for Zika virus infection, and women who become infected while pregnant are at risk of having babies with severe congenital abnormalities.In their study, the scientists first infected mice with Zika virus and allowed the animals' immune systems to produce anti-Zika antibodies.They identified six different antibodies that recognised a particular Zika protein, the envelope or E protein. Of those, four were shown in test-tube experiments to inhibit an Asian strain of Zika virus from infecting cells.In addition to inhibiting the Asian strain, two of the four antibodies also neutralised Zika virus strains derived from Africa and South America (Brazil).In additional experiments, the scientists first prophylactically treated mice with either the most potent Zika neutralising antibodies or with antibodies directed towards an unrelated Chikungunya virus, and a day later exposed the mice to Zika virus.Mice given Chikungunya antibodies developed high levels of Zika virus in their blood and lost weight, and most died.In contrast, mice given Zika antibodies as a preventive treatment developed lower levels of Zika virus and did not develop any clinical signs of infection.The researchers note that the key question of whether Zika neutralising antibodies could protect pregnant women and their developing foetuses remains to be answered.Due to significant differences in gestational features between mice and humans, antibody protection studies may require experiments in other mammals, such as non-human primates, that allow for optimal transfer of antibodies from the mother to the foetus, as occurs in humans, they noted."
Solar plane lands in Egypt in penultimate stop of world tour,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Solar-plane-lands-in-Egypt-in-penultimate-stop-of-world-tour/articleshow/53194089.cms,"CAIRO: The Solar Impulse 2 landed in Cairo on Wednesday for its penultimate stop as the solar-powered plane nears the end of its marathon tour around the world.After the two-day flight from Spain, just one final leg lies between it and its final destination, Abu Dhabi, where it started its odyssey in March last year.The aircraft landed in Spain last month, after completing the first solo transatlantic flight powered only by sunlight.After setting off from Seville on Monday morning, the plane passed through Algerian, Tunisian, Italian and Greek airspace, and flew over the Giza Pyramids before touching down at Cairo airport at around 7:10 am (0510 GMT).Its support crew cheered as the plane, no heavier than a car but with the wingspan of a Boeing 747, landed, and trailed after it on bicycles.It had finished the 3,745 kilometre (2,327 mile) journey with an average speed of 76.7 kilometres (47.7 miles) an hour, the flight organiser said.""It was fantastic, everything worked well,"" pilot Andre Borschberg told the control tower, as a live stream from the cockpit was broadcast on Solar Impulse 2's Facebook page.He emerged from the cockpit and hugged Bertrand Piccard, with whom he has taken turns flying the plane around the world.Solar Impulse is being flown on its 35,400-kilometre (22,000 mile) trip in stages, with Piccard and his Swiss compatriot Borschberg alternating at the controls of the single-seat plane.Picard, who had arrived early to greet the aircraft, told reporters that flying Solar Impulse 2 showed what new technologies can do.The 58-year-old had flown the plane across the Atlantic in a 6,765 kilometre (4,200 mile) journey.It had completed its flight from New York to Seville in 71 hours, flying through the night with the energy stored in its 17,000 photovoltaic cells.""It's a new era for energy,"" he said.""I love to fly this plane because when you are in the air for several days you have the impression to be in a film of science fiction,"" he said.""You look at the sun, you look at your motors, they turn for days and for days, no fuel. And you think that's a miracle. That's magic. It is actually the reality of today. This is what we can do with these new technologies.""He said the pilot takes 20 minute naps during the long flights, as the plane inches across the sky.Borschberg had piloted the plane in its 8,924 kilometre (5,545 mile) flight from Japan to Hawaii in 118 hours, breaking the previous record for the longest uninterrupted journey in aviation history.""It is comfortable. But of course you need to train for that,"" Piccard said.Borschberg and Piccard have said they want to raise awareness of renewable energy sources and technologies with their project.Picard said the plane could fly continuously. ""The pilot is the limit,"" he told AFP.""You capture the energy during the day, you use it in the engines and store it, and during the night you use the storage from the batteries, and you continue cycle after cycle,"" he said.Borschberg said a 20-day long flight could be on the cards.""Will we be able to fly longer? I believe we will fly 20 days. But you have to be sustainable. You have to produce water. You have to produce oxygen,"" he said.Piccard does not expect solar powered commercial planes any time soon.""But there will be passengers very soon in electric airplanes that we will charge on the ground.""On the ground you can charge batteries and you can have short haul flights maybe 500 kilometres (310 miles) with 50 people flying in these planes"" in a decade, he predicted."
'Why do docs shy away from diagnosing occupational diseases?',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Why-do-docs-shy-away-from-diagnosing-occupational-diseases/articleshow/53193241.cms,"JAIPUR: Earlier this month, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Jodhpur hosted a conference on occupational health. Given that there are over 5,300 patients of silicosis in the state, occupational health is a big concern in Rajasthan. One of the speakers at the seminar insisted that no amount of NGO action or government compensation can reverse the trend of the large numbers of people falling prey to occupational disease. Only when a proper diagnosis is made, and when people are informed of the prognosis once the condition is detected, can the battle against occupational disease be won, said Dr Murlidhar Venkateshwaran, who in the 1990s was actively involved in making the diagnosis of byssinosis among textile workers in Maharashtra.Byssinosis is a lung disease that afflicts people who work with cotton and yarn and are exposed to the dust of these for long periods, working as they do in poorly ventilated spaces.Venkateshwaran told TOI that the trend was for doctors to conduct research and write for medical journals about occupational diseases. ""However, often these are conditions that are incurable, and doctors sometimes think there is no purpose served in informing the patient. I think that is unethical. The worker must know the prognosis. He must know why he is falling sick.""Dr MK Devarajan of the Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission, who also participated in the Jodhpur conference, said, ""Occupational diseases like silicosis and asbestosis are notified diseases, under the Mines Act, the Factories Act and the Building and Other Construction Workers Act. However, until the human rights commission stepped in, diagnoses of these diseases was not notified. Even despite all our circulars, the number of cases notified is not substantial. Doctors seem reluctant to make the diagnosis.""Venkateshwaran explained that proper diagnosis is key to fighting occupational disease. ""If you look at WHO data, you will find that the percentage of occupational diseases registered in India is much less than, say, Norway. This is because there is also a data gap, because of poor diagnosis.""There are 34 diseases that are 'notified' diseases in India - once a medical practitioner diagnoses the condition, he or she is bound by law to inform authorities. Many of these are also diseases for which workers can claim compensation, under the Workmen's Compensation Act. However, many silicosis patients work in illegal mines, and cannot avail compensation.In 2013, the government of Rajasthan began to offer patients of silicosis Rs1 lakh in compensation, once the diagnosis was certified by the Pneumoconiosis Board. Those who lost a member of the family to silicosis could claim Rs3 lakh.Venkateshwaran said it was unfortunate that doctors are sometimes engaged by the very firms where the workers are falling ill, and are encouraged to not diagnose the condition. Diagnosis would place the burden of compensation on the employer. He said this was the condition not just in India, but even abroad. ""If the doctor is paid by the private employer, he might risk losing his job. However, even doctors who are not on the private firm's pay roll are often reluctant to make the diagnosis,"" Venkateshwaran said.Dr DR Meena, director, public health of the state government refused to offer any comments on whether doctors were justified in fearing to make a proper diagnosis of occupational illnesses."

"In a first, IVF with frozen embryo used for breeding indigenous cows",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/In-a-first-IVF-with-frozen-embryo-used-for-breeding-indigenous-cows/articleshow/53305468.cms,"Gopalpur (Chhattisgarh) in-virto fertilization technique (IVF) and frozen embryo has been successfully used to establish pregnancy in livestock for the first time Indiaâ€”a major breakthrough for genetically improving, conserving and propagating indigenous cow breeds. Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh on Wednesday launched ""JK BovaGenix"" that will focus on producing IVF embryos on a large scale from indigenous cattle breeds at Dr Vijayapat Singhania Centre for Excellence for Assisted Reproductive Techniques here in Janjgir Champa district. The project is of J K Trustâ€”an NGO which has been working towards livestock breed improvement using artificial insemination technology for the last four decades.Establishment of pregnancies using frozen embryo is for the first time in India at present the centre has 28 cows with 14 pregnancies through IVF and 14 through frozen IVF embryos in the last three months since its inception. The first batch of IVF calves are expected to be born by the year. In 2012, a calf was born with this technique but the attempt was unsuccessful.In IVF technique, the ova is aspirated manually from the donor mother's ovary and is then combined with male semen to develop an ova into an embryo, which can be frozen and preserved for many years. These embryos are then transplanted into recipient mothers to produce live calves.Speaking at the function, chief minister Raman Singh said this is an initiative that his government will support. ""I think this can be developed further with the assistance from other states as it would help protect and propagate indigenous cow breeds and boost milk output"", he added.Dr V P Singhania, JK trust chairman, expressed the hope that success of the programme would create several thousand high milk yielding cattle and good quality of bulls in the near future.Union agriculture ministry's animal husbandry commissioner Suresh S Honnappagol described the research and the breakthrough as a major step towards preserving indigenous cattle breed and improving its milk yield. He said the centre has already earmarked Rs 850 crores for various technological and programmes that will ultimately benefit the farmers. Dr Shyam Zavar, CEO and a pioneer in embryo transfer research, said the project aims to rapidly multiply and upgrade indigenous breeds of cattle such as Gir from Gujarat, Sahiwal from Punjab and Haryana, Tarparkar from Rajasthan and Ongole from Andhra Pradesh and others. There are 40 indigenous breeds of cattle and 13 breeds of buffalos in the country.He said indigenous cattle breed in India have a lower milk yield as compared to the same breed in other parts of the world. For instance, he said, indigenous breed like Gir produce 2.5 times more milk in Brazil as compared to our country because of the genetic improvement and not necessarily by eating twice the quantity of fodder.Chief minister Raman Singh also launched a mobile cattle IVF and embryo transfer lab, the first in the country, which will facilitate this advanced assisted re-productive technology to the door steps of the farmers in villages across many states."

What is a constant cycle of violent news doing to us?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/What-is-a-constant-cycle-of-violent-news-doing-to-us/articleshow/53252668.cms,"It has been a rough year.By now, our violence is down to a pattern, and there is a choreography to our reactions.A killer seeks out a nightclub, a church, an airport, a courthouse, a protest. Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group.Our phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout ""breaking news"" in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites.Journalists create multimedia stories that focus on videos, photos and graphic accounts from victims and witnesses. The experts give interviews, and the latest tools of immediacy are put to use. After the attack in Nice, France, The Times invited grief counselors to be interviewed on Facebook Live.What is this doing to us?It depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita Gadhia-Smith, a psychologist in Washington, said Friday.""With the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that's building in people,"" she said, ""a sense of vulnerability and powerlessness.""Smith added: ""There is a heightened alarm but there can also be some desensitization that's happening.""The constant stream of news on social media can also be traumatic. A team of researchers at the University of Bradford in England told a British psychology conference last year that exposure to violent imagery on social media can cause symptoms that are similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, defined as a persistent emotional reaction to a traumatic event that severely impairs one's life.In an analysis conducted by the Bradford researchers, 189 participants were shown images and provided with stories of violent events, including the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and suicide bombings.The researchers' analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw.The study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images.What can we do about it?The self-care advice hasn't changed. It is natural to want to follow along with incremental updates on social media and in the news. But it's important to know that this can heighten your anxiety.Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media.Designating times to plug into the news â€” checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance â€” can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed.""This will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,"" Albano said, ""or a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn't have the impact that you would think it has.""If you're feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts.When you fear the worst, it's hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride, has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try.Humans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year.""Every single anxiety-management technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion"" to the likelihood of danger, Seif said.Also, remember to take a breath.A guide to dealing with terrorism released by the FBI encourages closing your eyes and taking deep breaths to feel calmer.Taking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help.The guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods â€” basic self-care guidelines that help reduce stress.Make sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say.If you have children, the American Psychological Association recommends asking them how they are feeling about the news. Keep in mind that it is possible for children to be influenced by news reports and the adult conversations around them. Lastly, keep your daily routine.Albano said that a primary worry in the field of psychology is people ""going out of their way to be so safe that it shrinks their world.""""Terrorists thrive on this kind of thing,"" she added. ""They want to see the population change their practices.""Going out of your way to avoid interacting with strangers â€” by taking mass transit, for example â€” can stoke fear and anxiety in children, she said.The best way to help children cope with acts of violence is to start by listening to them, Sean Rogers, a psychotherapist who works with children and teenagers, told The Times on his Facebook Live appearance.""Listening is curative,"" he said. ""It is the basis of all therapies."""

Music likes and dislikes are not hard-wired in human brains: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Music-likes-and-dislikes-are-not-hard-wired-in-human-brains-Study/articleshow/53208450.cms,"NEW DELHI: Are some types of music - combinations of musical notes - intrinsically more liked by humans than others? This is what many experts have belied for a long time. But a new study from MIT and Brandeis University has found that such likes and dislikes are culturally acquired and there is nothing hardwired in the brain.In a study of more than 100 people belonging to a remote Amazonian tribe called Tsimane, with little or no exposure to Western music, the researchers found that dissonant chords such as the combination of C and F were rated just as likeable as ""consonant"" chords, which feature simple integer ratios between the acoustical frequencies of the two notes.""This study suggests that preferences for consonance over dissonance depend on exposure to Western musical culture, and that the preference is not innate,"" says Josh McDermott, of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.McDermott and Ricardo Godoy, a professor at Brandeis University, led the study, which appears in Nature on July 13.For centuries, some scientists have hypothesized that the brain is wired to respond favorably to consonant chords such as the fifth (so-called because one of the notes is five notes higher than the other). Others believe that these preferences are culturally determined, as a result of exposure to music featuring consonant chords. This debate has been difficult to resolve, in large part because nowadays there are very few people in the world who are not familiar with Western music and its consonant chords.""It's pretty hard to find people who don't have a lot of exposure to Western pop music due to its diffusion around the world,"" McDermott says. ""Most people hear a lot of Western music, and Western music has a lot of consonant chords in it. It's thus been hard to rule out the possibility that we like consonance because that's what we're used to, but also hard to provide a definitive test.""The Tsimane are a farming and foraging society of about 12,000 people, with very limited exposure to Western music. So the issue could be tested with them. The Tsimane's own music features both singing and instrumental performance, but usually by only one person at a time.The researchers did two sets of studies, one in 2011 and one in 2015 asking participants to rate how much they liked dissonant and consonant chords. The same tests were performed with a group of Spanish-speaking Bolivians who live in a small town near the Tsimane, and residents of the Bolivian capital, La Paz. They also tested groups of American musicians and non-musicians.""What we found is the preference for consonance over dissonance varies dramatically across those five groups,"" McDermott says. ""In the Tsimane it's undetectable, and in the two groups in Bolivia, there's a statistically significant but small preference. In the American groups it's quite a bit larger, and it's bigger in the musicians than in the nonmusicians.""When asked to rate nonmusical sounds such as laughter and gasps, the Tsimane showed similar responses to the other groups. They also showed the same dislike for a musical quality known as acoustic roughness."
Great Red Spot the source of heat on Jupiter: Scientists,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Great-Red-Spot-the-source-of-heat-on-Jupiter-Scientists/articleshow/53429985.cms,"WASHINGTON: Jupiter's Great Red Spot with its swirl of reddish hues may be the mysterious heat source behind the planet's surprisingly high upper atmospheric temperatures, new Nasa-funded research suggests.The Great Red Spot (GRS) has delighted and mystified since its discovery in the 17th Century.It is two-three times as wide as Earth and is seen by many as a ""perpetual hurricane"" with winds peaking at about 400 miles an hour.Here on Earth, sunlight heats the atmosphere at altitudes well above the surface - for example, at 250 miles above our planet where the International Space Station (ISS) orbits.Scientists have been stumped as to why temperatures in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are comparable to those found at Earth, yet Jupiter is more than five times the distance from the Sun.Researchers from Boston University's Center for Space Physics set out to solve the mystery by mapping temperatures well above Jupiter's cloud tops using observations from Earth.They analysed data from the SpeX spectrometer at Nasa's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.By observing non-visible infrared light hundreds of miles above the gas giant, scientists found temperatures to be much higher in certain latitudes and longitudes in Jupiter's southern hemisphere, where the spot is located.""We could see almost immediately that our maximum temperatures at high altitudes were above the Great Red Spot far below - a weird coincidence or a major clue?"" said James O'Donoghue from Boston University.The study, appeared in the journal Nature, found that the storm in the Great Red Spot produces two kinds of turbulent energy waves that collide and heat the upper atmosphere.Gravity waves are much like how a guitar string moves when plucked, while acoustic waves are compressions of the air (sound waves).Heating in the upper atmosphere 500 miles above the Great Red Spot is thought to be caused by a combination of these two wave types ""crashing,"" like ocean waves on a beach.""The extremely high temperatures observed above the storm appear to be the 'smoking gun' of this energy transfer,"" said O'Donoghue.""This tells us that planet-wide heating is a plausible explanation for the 'energy crisis,' a problem in which upper-atmospheric temperatures are measured hundreds of degrees hotter than can be explained by sunlight alone,"" he pointed out.This effect has been observed over the Andes Mountains here on Earth and may also be happening elsewhere in the outer solar system.Scientists believe this phenomenon also occurs on giant exoplanets orbiting other stars.Nasa's Juno spacecraft, which recently arrived in Jupiter's orbit, will have several opportunities during its 20-month mission to observe the Great Red Spot and the turbulent region surrounding it."

SpaceX launching space station docking port for Nasa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/SpaceX-launching-space-station-docking-port-for-Nasa/articleshow/53247113.cms,"CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA: SpaceX aims to launch another load of space station supplies for Nasa, including a critical docking port needed by new US crew capsules set to debut next year.The unmanned Falcon rocket is scheduled to lift off early Monday. Excellent weather is forecast for the 12:45am launch.Aboard the rocket is a replica of the docking port destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. This is second port, Nasa needs at least one and preferably two of these ports for crew capsules under development by both SpaceX and Boeing.Americans have been stuck riding Russian rockets to the International Space Station since shuttles stopped flying five years ago this month. The SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner capsules will ease this Russian dependency.SpaceX, meanwhile, will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just a couple miles from the Falcon launch pad. The California-based company wants to reuse its rockets to save time and money. It's only landed a used first-stage booster on land once, back in December. Three other boosters touched down vertically on an ocean platform, after delivering spacecraft to orbit.SpaceX's vice president of flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, said Saturday that the company plans to launch its first recycled booster this fall.The SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, meanwhile, holds about 5,000 pounds of food, science experiments and equipment. One-thousand pounds of that is the all-important docking port.For the first time ever, the Nasa press site at Kennedy Space Center will be evacuated for Monday's launch attempt, as will the neighboring Vehicle Assembly Building and the rest of the former shuttle launch complex. A risk evaluation by the Air Force shows that the Dragon capsule, full of toxic fuel, could parachute down into this targeted area in the event of a launch failure. The wind is expected to be blowing right in the press site's direction, thus the evacuation order.Journalists as well as Nasa and SpaceX public relations staff and VIPs have been ordered to find alternative viewing sites.To save a cargo-laden Dragon in case of a launch accident, SpaceX added the option of releasing the capsule's parachutes in just such an emergency. The change came after a Dragon and all its contents were destroyed when the Falcon rocket failed shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral in June 2015.The SpaceX Dragon is the only supply ship capable of returning items to Earth from the space station, thus the original need for parachutes."

CCMB-SCIC ink MoU on sickle cell disease research,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/CCMB-SCIC-ink-MoU-on-sickle-cell-disease-research/articleshow/53398560.cms,"HYDERABAD: The city-based, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), a premier institute under Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has signed a long-term Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sickle Cell Institute Chhattisgarh (SCIC), Raipur, an autonomous institute of the Government of Chhattisgarh. Sickle cell anemia is a serious disorder of hemoglobin metabolism and is widely prevalent in the States of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Orissa and sparingly in other places. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia â€” a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body of an individual. The disease occurs globally due to a single mutation in the beta globin gene and follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance meaning that parents are usually the carriers of defective beta globin gene and the disease occurs when both copies of the defective gene are inherited together in the children, CCMB said in a press note. The MoU combines the clinical expertise of the SCIC with the molecular biology expertise and genetic testing experience of CSIR-CCMB. Under the MoU, both institutes will strive to reduce the burden of Sickle Cell Anemia, primarily, in the State of Chhattisgarh. Dr Pradeep K Patra, Director General, SCIC, Raipur informed that they had already screened 15 lakh individuals in the State under the State-sponsored programme and identified 10 per cent of them to be carrier for the disease. Both CSIR-CCMB and SCIC will work together to identify eligible carrier couples who are at risk of giving birth to an affected child and follow them with genetic testing, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling. Speaking on the occasion, Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CSIR-CCMB said, ""We are committed to reducing the societal burden of sickle cell anemia in India and countries like Cyprus and Sardinia have already been successful in the near abolition of risk of hemoglobinopathies by such collaborations of scientists and clinicians."" The disease manifests early in life and leads to variable clinical course in different individuals despite all of them carrying the same mutation. Rakesh Mishra said both institutes would also conduct cutting-edge research to identify molecular markers to understand the molecular basis of these differences and thus help identify newer management strategies and eventually a therapy for the disease.The MoU was signed by Dr Rakesh K Mishra, Director, CSIR-CCMB and Dr Pradeep K Patra, Director General, SCIC in the presence of Dr G R Chandak, Senior Scientist and In-charge, Molecular Diagnostics and Dr M Vishnupriya, Head of PME at CSIR-CCMB."

Solar plane nears end of historic round-the-world trip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Solar-plane-nears-end-of-historic-round-the-world-trip/articleshow/53384399.cms,"ABU DHABI: Solar Impulse 2 was on Monday approaching the end of its epic bid to become the first sun-powered airplane to circle the globe without a drop of fuel to promote renewable energy.When the experimental aircraft touches down in Abu Dhabi in the early hours of Tuesday it will cap a remarkable 42,000-kilometre (26,097 mile) journey across four continents, two oceans and three seas.With Swiss explorer and project director Bertrand Piccard in the cockpit, the plane is due to land at Al-Bateen Executive Airport in the UAE capital where it launched its tour on March 9, 2015.By 1300 GMT on Monday, Solar Impulse 2 had travelled more than 2,200 kilometres (1,400 miles) in nearly 38 hours on its final leg, flying over Qatar's northern tip after crossing the vast Saudi desert.""Thanks to our lovely #sun, #Si2's batteries are fully charged,"" the Solar Impulse team said on Twitter.""After a turbulent night from extreme high temperatures, the sun rose above a desert of sand dunes above #SaudiArabia,"" Piccard tweeted earlier.Dubbed the ""paper plane"", Solar Impulse 2 is circumnavigating the globe in stages, with 58-year-old Piccard and his compatriot Andre Borschberg taking turns at the controls of the single-seat aircraft.It took off from Cairo on its final leg early on Sunday, having previously crossed Asia, North America, Europe and North Africa.Borschberg, 63, smashed the record for the longest uninterrupted journey in aviation history with the 8,924-kilometre (5,500-mile) flight between Nagoya, Japan and Hawaii that lasted nearly 118 hours.""#Si2 is both the 1st airplane of unlimited endurance & the only experimental aircraft allowed to fly over cities!"" he tweeted on Monday.No heavier than a car but with the wingspan of a Boeing 747, the four-engine battery-powered aircraft relies on around 17,000 solar cells embedded in its wings.Its broad wings and light weight make it particularly sensitive to turbulence.The plane has clocked an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) an hour.The pilots use oxygen tanks to breathe at high altitude and wear suits specially designed to cope with the extreme conditions.They must withstand temperatures inside the tiny cockpit ranging from minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) to plus 35 degrees C (plus 95 degrees F).The plane, equipped with a parachute and life raft in case of an accident, flew at an altitude exceeding 30,000 feet (9,144 metres) over Saudi Arabia on Sunday.Piccard has said he launched the project in 2003 to show that renewable energy ""can achieve the impossible"".His dream looks set to come true, but it did take much longer than planned.The attempt was initially expected to last five months, including 25 days of actual flying.But the aircraft was grounded in July last year when its solar-powered batteries suffered problems halfway through the trip.The project has also been beset by bad weather and illness which forced Piccard to delay the final leg.While in the air, the pilot is constantly in contact with mission control in Monaco, where a team of weathermen, mathematicians and engineers monitors the route and prepares flight strategies.""It's a project for energy, for a better world,"" Piccard told journalists in Cairo before taking off on the final leg.A psychiatrist who made the first non-stop balloon flight around the world in 1999, Piccard had warned that the last leg of the Solar Impulse 2 tour would be difficult because of the high temperatures.""It's been two hours now I'm flying into high up and down drafts. And I can't even drink. It's really exhausting..."" he tweeted on Sunday.Speaking to the BBC from the cockpit, Piccard described the final stage as a ""fantastic moment"" and likened the plane to a ""flying laboratory"".""We are testing all these new, clean and modern technologies in order to fly with an endless endurance,"" he said.While the pilots do not expect commercial solar-powered planes any time soon, they hope the project will help spur wider progress in clean energy.""We have new insulation material, new LED lamps, we have new extremely light carbon fibre structures...

How Twitter helped solve Milky Way mystery,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/How-Twitter-helped-solve-Milky-Way-mystery/articleshow/53301658.cms,"TORONTO: Taking help from Twitter, two astronomers have uncovered the strongest evidence yet that an enormous X-shaped structure made of stars lies within the central bulge of the Milky Way galaxy.Previous computer models and observations of our own galaxy have suggested that the X-shaped structure existed.But no one had observed it directly. Some astronomers argued that previous research that pointed indirectly to the existence of the X could be explained in other ways.""There was controversy about whether the X-shaped structure existed. But our paper gives a good view of the core of our own galaxy. I think it has provided pretty good evidence for the existence of the X-shaped structure,"" said Dustin Lang, research associate at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto.The Milky Way Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy â€” a disk-shaped collection of dust, gas and billions of stars, 100,000 light-years in diameter.The central bulge, like other barred galaxy's bulges, resembles a rectangular box or peanut when viewed â€” as we view it â€” from within the plane of the galaxy.The X-shaped structure is an integral component of the bulge.Lang's analysis was originally intended to aid in his research in mapping the web of galaxies beyond the Milky Way galaxy.To help explore the maps he had developed from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope data, he created an interactive map-browsing website and tweeted an image of the entire sky.""Melissa Ness, post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, saw the tweet and immediately recognised the importance of the X-shaped structure,"" Lang noted.""The bulge is a key signature of formation of the Milky Way galaxy. If we understand the bulge we will understand the key processes that have formed and shaped our galaxy,"" Ness added in a paper appeared The results appear in the Astronomical Journal.It is also evidence that our galaxy did not experience major merging events since the bulge formed. If it had, interactions with other galaxies would have disrupted its shape."
"For the first time, scientists to sequence genes in space",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/For-the-first-time-scientists-to-sequence-genes-in-space/articleshow/53216191.cms,"CAPE CANAVERAL: Given her background in researching some of the deadliest pathogens on Earth, including Ebola, colleagues of newly arrived astronaut Kate Rubins had expected her to want to do ""crazy science fiction"" on the International Space Station.Instead, Rubins pushed for carefully controlled experiments with a mix of a bacteria, a common virus and mouse cells, all already repeatedly sequenced and safe for testing in the space station's closed-loop environment.Rubins, a trained microbiologist who arrived at the space station on Saturday, will be using the samples to put Oxford Nanopore's MinION sequencer - a pocket-sized DNA sequencer - through its paces.The tests are intended to prove whether the technology can be used to understand microbes in the space station, to scan fellow astronauts for genetic changes that could diagnose illness, and in future missions, potentially to test samples from Mars and elsewhere for signs of DNA-based life.One of the first things the scientists need to prove is just how well the machine operates in microgravity. ""Technology behaves differently up here. Fluids behave differently up here,"" Rubins said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday from the International Space Station.The MinION sequencer, which is about half the size of a smartphone, operates fundamentally differently from current DNA sequencers, said Sarah Wallace, a microbiologist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space Center in Houston.With most sequencers, scientists put in a sample and it runs for 24 to 48 hours, then stops. The station's sequencer displays its analysis as it works.""Within minutes of loading your sample, you're starting to get the sequence data back ... so how long it runs is based on the scientific question you're asking,"" Wallace said.The MinION DNA sequencer is among the nearly 4,900 pounds (2,223 kg) of cargo scheduled to be launched to the station on Monday aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.It will be the first use of the machine in space, Wallace said in a news briefing on Wednesday.Currently, samples from space must be frozen and flown back to Earth for analysis.""We don't get to analyze everything that is happening to human beings and to cells in real time,"" Rubins said.In the future, Rubins would like to use the DNA sequencer to learn more about potential colonies of microbes that have taken up residence in the station's water system and elsewhere aboard the orbiting laboratory.""We've got wonderful clean water, but we've got a water system that's been up here for 15 years. Do we have any microbes living in the system?"" Rubins said.If all checks out, the DNA sequencer could be used to help diagnose illness in astronauts on the space station and understand whether any disease-causing microbes are susceptible to antibiotics, helping to conserve valuable medications that cannot be readily restocked.The device joins a suite of other diagnostic instruments aboard the station, including a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, device that can test single genes.""These kinds of small, portable genomic technologies are going to let us look, in real time, at what's actually happening to bone degradation, for example. What's happening to your immune system, what's happening to a population of microbes that you bring up in a culture flask?"" Rubins said.Testing the DNA sequencer in space also could pave the way for its use in remote or resource-poor areas on Earth.""This kind of device is something you would use in the developing world, you could use this in an outbreak situation, you could use this in a clinic where you don't have a lot of resources to buy a full-scale sequencer but you can enable some kinds of diagnostic tests in really resource-poor settings,"" Rubins said.Rubins said the space station is an ""amazing place"" to test device performance when power and data processing capabilities are limited.""We have to engineer devices that are going to work in space stations. Those same things are going to work in the most remote regions on Earth,"" Rubins said."

Nasa probe set for date with near-Earth asteroid,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nasa-probe-set-for-date-with-near-Earth-asteroid/articleshow/53392014.cms,"WASHINGTON: US space agency Nasa will launch a spacecraft in September to a near-Earth asteroid known as Bennu to harvest a sample of surface material and return it to the Earth to scan for signs of life.Nasa's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will measure the spectral signatures of Bennu's mineralogical and molecular components. Ideally, the sample will come from a region in which the building blocks of life may be found.Known as OVIRS (OSIRIS-REx Visible and Infrared Spectrometer), the instrument on board will measure visible and near-infrared light reflected and emitted from the asteroid and split the light into its component wavelengths, much like a prism that splits sunlight into a rainbow.""OVIRS is key to our search for organics on Bennu. In particular, we will rely on it to find the areas of Bennu rich in organic molecules to identify possible sample sites of high science value, as well as the asteroid's general composition,"" explained Lauretta, principal investigator for the OSIRIS-REx mission at University of Arizona in Tucson.OVIRS will work in tandem with another OSIRIS-REx instrument -- the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES).While OVIRS maps the asteroid in the visible and near infrared, OTES picks up in the thermal infrared.This will allow the science team to map the entire asteroid over a range of wavelengths that are most interesting to scientists searching for organics and water.In the visible and infrared spectrum, minerals and other materials have unique signatures like fingerprints.These fingerprints allow scientists to identify various organic materials, as well as carbonates, silicates and absorbed water, on the surface of the asteroid.The data will actually allow scientists to make a map of the relative abundance of various materials across Bennu's surface.""I can't think of a spectral payload that has been quite this comprehensive before,"" said Dennis Reuter, OVIRS instrument scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.As the spacecraft approaches Bennu, OVIRS will view one entire hemisphere at a time to measure how the spectrum changes as the asteroid rotates, allowing scientists to compare ground-based observations to those from the spacecraft.Once at the asteroid, OVIRS will gather spectral data and create detailed maps of the surface and help in the selection of a sample site.Despite its capabilities to perform complex science, OVIRS is surprisingly inexpensive and compact in its design.The entire spectrometer operates at 10 watts, requiring less power than a standard household light bulb.Unlike most spectrometers, OVIRS has no moving parts, reducing the risk of a malfunction.""We designed OVIRS to be robust and capable of lasting a long time in space,"" Reuter said in a Nasa statement.The team also had to plan for another major threat: water.Immediately after launch, the team will turn on heaters on the instrument to bake off any water.The heat will not be intense enough to cause any damage to OVIRS, and the team will turn the heaters off once all of the water has evaporated."
How brain controls our breathing discovered,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/How-brain-controls-our-breathing-discovered/articleshow/53086606.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have discovered how the brain controls our breathing in response to changing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, a finding that has important implications for babies who experience reduced levels of oxygen during birth.The control of breathing is essential for life. Without an adequate response to increased carbon dioxide levels, people can suffer from breathing disturbances, sickness, and panic, researchers said.In worst-case scenarios, it can lead to premature death, as in sudden infant death syndrome, they said.Researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden conducted a study in mice and found that when exposed to decreased oxygen or increased carbon dioxide levels, the brain releases a small molecule called Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to help protect itself and regulate breathing.To discover this mechanism, researchers grew a section of a mouse's brainstem (the central trunk of the brain) in a type of dish.The slice contained an arrangement of nerve and supporting cells that allowed it to 'breathe' for three weeks. During this time, researchers monitored the cells and their behaviour in response to changes in the environment.""Our novel brainstem culture first revealed that cells responsible for breathing operate in a small-world network. Groups of these cells work very closely with each other, with each group interconnected by a few additional cells that appear to work as hubs,"" said David Forsberg from Karolinska.""This networking activity and the rhythmic respiratory motor output it generated were preserved for the full three weeks, suggesting that our brainstem can be used for long-term studies of respiratory neural network activity,"" said Forsberg.Researchers saw that exposure to different substances made the brainstem breathe faster or slower.""Perhaps most interesting was its response to carbon dioxide, which triggered a release of PGE2. Here, PGE2 acted as a signalling molecule that increased breathing activity in the carbon dioxide-sensitive brainstem region, leading to slower and deeper breaths, or 'sighs,' said Forsberg.These new insights have important implications for babies, who experience significantly reduced levels of oxygen during birth, researchers said.At this stage, PGE2 protects the brain and prepares the brainstem to generate deep sigh-like breath intakes, resulting in the first breaths of air following birth, they said.""Our findings go some way to explaining how and why our breathing responses to imbalanced oxygen and carbon dioxide levels are impaired during infectious episodes,"" said Eric Herlenius from Karolinska.""It also helps further our understanding of why infection can inhibit breathing so severely in new-born babies,"" he said.The findings were published in the journal eLife."

Scientists break microwave detection record,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Scientists-break-microwave-detection-record/articleshow/53140863.cms,"LONDON: Researchers have created the world's smallest and most sensitive microwave detector, beating the previous record by fourteen fold, an advance which may help in making ultra-sensitive cameras and accessories for emerging quantum computers.The detector, which is smaller than a human blood cell, has a simple design of superconducting aluminum and a single golden nanowire.""For us size matters. The smaller the better. With smaller detectors, we get more signal and cheaper price in mass production,"" said Mikko Mottonen from Aalto University in Finland.This design guarantees both efficient absorption of incoming photons and very sensitive readout. The whole detector is smaller than a single human blood cell, the researchers said.The new detector works at a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero temperature. Thermal disturbances at such low temperatures are so weak that researchers could detect energy packets of only a single zeptojoule, they said.That is the energy needed to lift a red blood cell by just a single nanometre, they added.The device uses an external energy source to amplify its readings, allowing scientists to recognize the most minuscule of thermal energy changes.Microwaves are currently used in mobile phone communications and satellite televisions, thanks to their ability to pass through walls.More sensitive microwave detectors may lead to great improvements of the present communication systems and measurement techniques, researchers said.Besides communication systems, the new detector could be used as a measurement device in the emerging superconducting quantum computer, they said.""Existing superconducting technology can produce single microwave photons,"" said Joonas Govenius from Aalto University.""However, detection of such travelling photons efficiently is a major outstanding challenge. Our results provide a leap towards solving this problem using thermal detection,"" Govenius said.A microwave detector may also be useful for thermodynamics of small systems, researchers said.""Quantum thermodynamics may give yet another boost to technology since it deals with individual energy levels or particles, and is in this sense more precise than classical thermodynamics,"" said Mottonen.The findings were published in the journal Physical Review Letters."

Nasa's Juno spacecraft enters Jupiter's magnetic field,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nasas-Juno-spacecraft-enters-Jupiters-magnetic-field/articleshow/53005348.cms,"WASHINGTON: Nasa's Jupiter-bound Juno spacecraft has entered the planet's magnetosphere, where the movement of particles in space is controlled by what is going on inside Jupiter.""We've just crossed the boundary into Jupiter's home turf,"" said Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton of Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio.""We're closing in fast on the planet itself and already gaining valuable data,"" said Bolton.Juno is on course to swing into orbit around Jupiter on July 4. Science instruments on board detected changes in the particles and fields around the spacecraft as it passed from an environment dominated by the interplanetary solar wind into Jupiter's magnetosphere.Data from Juno's Waves investigation indicate the spacecraft's crossing of the bow shock just outside the magnetosphere on June 24 and the transit into the lower density of the Jovian magnetosphere on June 25.""The bow shock is analogous to a sonic boom,"" said William Kurth of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, lead co-investigator for the Waves investigation.""The solar wind blows past all the planets at a speed of about a million miles per hour, and where it hits an obstacle, there's all this turbulence,"" said Kurth.The obstacle is Jupiter's magnetosphere, which is the largest structure in the solar system.""If Jupiter's magnetosphere glowed in visible light, it would be twice the size of the full moon as seen from Earth,"" Kurth said.And that is the shorter dimension of the teardrop-shaped structure; the dimension extending outward behind Jupiter has a length about five times the distance between Earth and the Sun.Out in the solar wind a few days ago, Juno was speeding through an environment that has about 16 particles per cubic inch. Once it crossed into the magnetosphere, the density was about a hundredfold less.The density is expected to climb again, inside the magnetosphere, as the spacecraft gets closer to Jupiter itself.The motions of these particles travelling under the control of Jupiter's magnetic field will be one type of evidence Juno examines for clues about Jupiter's deep interior.While this transition from the solar wind into the magnetosphere was predicted to occur at some point in time, the structure of the boundary between those two regions proved to be unexpectedly complex, with different instruments reporting unusual signatures both before and after the nominal crossing."
Thinking 'I can do better' can improve performance: study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Thinking-I-can-do-better-can-improve-performance-study/articleshow/53023910.cms,"LONDON: Telling yourself that you can do better can actually improve your performance at a given task, a new study has claimed.Over 44,000 people took part in an experiment to discover what motivational techniques really worked. The participants were divided into 12 experimental groups and one control group.In conjunction with BBC Lab UK, Professor Andrew Lane from University of Wolverhampton and colleagues tested which physiological skills would help people improve their scores in an online game.The study examined if one motivational method would be more effective for any specific aspect of a task. The methods tested were self-talk, imagery, and if-then planning.Each of these psychological skills was applied to one of four parts of a competitive task: process, outcome, arousal-control, and instruction, researchers said.People using self-talk, for example telling yourself ""I can do better next time"" - performed better than the control group in every portion of the task.The greatest improvements were seen in self-talk-outcome â€” telling yourself, ""I can beat my best score"", self-talk-process â€” telling yourself, ""I can react quicker this time"", imagery-outcome â€” imagining yourself playing the game and beating your best score, and imagery-process â€” imagining yourself playing and reacting quicker than last time. Researchers also found a short motivational video could improve performance. Participants watched a short video before playing the online game.'If-then' planning was found to be one of the least successful of this study, despite being an effective tool in weight management and other real life challenges, researchers said.The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology."

Nasa's Juno probe to enter orbit of Jupiter today,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nasas-Juno-probe-to-enter-orbit-of-Jupiter-today/articleshow/53053491.cms,"LOS ANGELES: A solar-powered spacecraft is spinning toward Jupiter for the closest encounter with the biggest planet in our solar system.Nasa's Juno spacecraft will fire its main rocket engine late Monday to slow itself down from a speed of 150,000 mph (250,000 kph) and slip into orbit around Jupiter. With Juno on autopilot, the delicately choreographed move comes without any help from ground controllers.The spacecraft is traveling through a hostile radiation environment and rings of debris and dust, ""making for very serious hazards,"" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said during a morning briefing. But Juno should be able to withstand the harsh conditions because it's ""built like an armored tank,"" he said.The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, Nasa released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons.Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission.The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant â€” a ball of hydrogen and helium â€” unlike rocky Earth and Mars.With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed.Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter.Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth.Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system?""What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,"" Bolton said. ""We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.""There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking.The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers), took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments.Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) of Jupiter's clouds â€” closer than previous missions â€” to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup.Juno, built by Lockheed Martin, is an armored spacecraft â€” its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission.Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates â€” a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons."

'Made in India' power converters for experiments on origin of universe in Germany,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Made-in-India-power-converters-for-experiments-on-origin-of-universe-in-Germany/articleshow/53130589.cms,"HYDERABAD: To engage in experiments on the origins of the universe at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), Germany, India will contribute Rs 270 crore (36 million Euros) in the form of high technology equipment. As part of the agreement, two Ultra Stable Power Converters (USPC) designed and developed at ECIL were flagged off to Darmstadt near Frankfurt Germany on Saturday.What is significant is that the entire design, development and production is an indigenous effort. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, and Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata provided the technical support to the Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) for designing, developing and manufacturing the all-important power converters.A total of 600 such converters will be supplied for the international science programme at Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (Fair), Germany. At Fair, the building blocks of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) director K N Vyas who flagged off the first consignment said this was the very first completely indigenous equipment that was being supplied for an international reputed science programme. The total cost of the power converters which would come in 30 different types would be Rs 67 crore (nine million euros).  ECIL chairman and managing director said a team from Germany had visited ECIL a couple of weeks ago and conducted 'Factory acceptance Tests' and certified and cleared the equipment for shipment to Germany. Sudhakar said the 'Made in India' equipment for an international science experiment was a matter of great pride for the nation. Sudhakar pointed out that technology denials by the international community had been so effectively overcome by India that now it had become impossible for other countries to ignore India. It may be mentioned here that in 2012, in CERN's Large Hadron Collidor, scientists had announced observation of a new particle, in their quest to know the origins of the universe. This confirmation of the ""Higgs boson"" or 'the god particle' as it was also referred to, gave insight into the origins of the universe. ""What we learnt was only five per cent from the experiment. There is still 95 per cent to be discovered, learnt and known,"" said D K Srivastava, former director of Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata. He said India can send scientists to carry out studies and experiments at FAIR.Subhasis Chattopadhyay, programme director at India-FAIR Coordination Centre, Bose Institute Kolkata, said the Indian industry was also being involved in developing and manufacturing equipment for FAIR. Though the power converters have been made for a specific purpose now, officials said they could also be made use of in societal applications, including treatment of cancer."

A touch screen helped a paralysed chimp walk again,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/A-touch-screen-helped-a-paralysed-chimp-walk-again/articleshow/53081074.cms,"TOKYO: In a first, Japanese researchers have rehabilitated a paralysed chimpanzee through interaction with computers and touch screens.The case of Reo, a male chimpanzee that learned to walk again after being paralysed due to illness, shows how much can be done to rehabilitate animals injured in captivity, said lead author Yoko Sakuraba of Kyoto University.Reo's example suggests that euthanasia does not have to be the only option for injured animals. The case was described in an article in Primates, the official journal of the Japan Monkey Centre published by Springer.In their normal work, researchers of the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University use chimpanzees' interaction with computers and touch screens to study the cognition and perception of these primates.When Reo was paralysed from the neck down, dedicated staff put this technology to further use by encouraging the animal to walk again.When Reo was 24 years old in 2006, he suddenly became paralysed when a portion of his spinal cord became inflamed.For the first ten months thereafter, the chimpanzee was severely disabled, lying on his back. He gradually recovered enough to sit up, and could later pull himself upright by using suspended ropes.Intensive physiotherapy over a period of 41 months followed, after which he was able to climb about again using only his arms.To aid Reo's ultimate integration back among the other twelve animals held at the institute, his carers decided to try to get him walking again.They incorporated a computerised task in this process. This was considered an option because in his youth Reo had learnt how to perform cognitive tasks on a touch panel, and in so doing had become used to receiving food rewards whenever he succeeded at tasks presented to him.A computer-controlled monitor was, therefore, placed on one wall, and cognitive tasks were again put to him.The rehabilitation sessions encouraged him to increase his movements considerably, and he started walking up to five hundred metres in a two-hour session. ""Cognitive tasks may be a useful way to rehabilitate physically disabled chimpanzees, and thus improve their welfare in captivity,"" Sakuraba said."

Why chronic pain risk is transmitted from parents to kids,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Why-chronic-pain-risk-is-transmitted-from-parents-to-kids/articleshow/53099561.cms,"WASHINGTON: Genetics, effects on early development and social learning are some of the factors that contribute to the risk of chronic pain being transmitted from parents to children, a new study has found.Amanda L Stone from Vanderbilt University and Anna C Wilson from Oregon Health & Science University in the US presented a conceptual model of transmission of chronic pain, including potential mechanisms and moderating factors.""Such a framework highlights chronic pain as inherently familial and intergenerational, opening up avenues for new models of intervention and prevention that can be family-centred and include at-risk children,"" they said.Knowing that offsprings of parents with chronic pain are at increased risk of developing chronic pain, as well as the adverse mental and physical health outcomes associated with chronic pain, researchers developed an ""integrative conceptual model"" to explore possible explanations for this risk.They identified five ""plausible mechanisms"" to explain the transmission of chronic disease risk from parent to child.The first mechanism was genetics. Children of parents with chronic pain might be at increased genetic risk for sensory as well as psychological components of pain, researchers said.Studies suggest that genetic factors may account for roughly half of the risk of chronic pain in adults, they said.Early neurobiological development also plays a role in the transmission of pain. Having a parent with chronic pain may affect the features and functioning of the nervous system during critical periods in early development.For example, a baby's development might be affected by the mother's stress level or health behaviours during and after pregnancy, researchers said.The third mechanism was pain-specific social learning. Children may learn ""maladaptive pain behaviours"" from their parents, who may act in ways that reinforce those behaviours.Catastrophising - exaggerated responses and worries about pain - might be one key factor, researchers said.General parenting and health habits also contributes in the transmission of pain.Chronic pain risk could be affected by parenting behaviours linked to adverse child outcomes - for example, permissive parenting or lack of consistency and warmth. The parents' physical activity level and other health habits might also play a role, researchers said.The fifth mechanism was exposure to stressful environment. There may be adverse effects from growing up in stressful circumstances related to chronic pain - for example, financial problems or parents' inability to perform daily tasks.The model also identifies some ""moderators"" that might explain when and under what circumstances children are at highest risk of developing chronic pain, researchers said.These include chronic pain in the other parent; the timing, course, and location of the parent's pain; and the children's characteristics, including their personal temperament, they said.The study was published in the journal Pain."

It is because USFDA tests are designed from panel made of greatest researchers, doctors, technicians & analysts of world. No medical device can be used in America until it's USFDA approved. In fact, most of drug manufacturing plants in India need to fulfill USFDA rules and regulations if they want to export their products in America. After putting the bioresorbabale vascular scaffolds, commonly known as dissolving heart stents, under series of tough tests for safety and efficacy, USFDA has given its verdict, informed Dr Chanana. ""It is for the first time in world that bioresorbable vascular scaffolds have received an USFDA approval. The additional features of bioresorbabale vascular scaffolds makes them extremely useful in cutting heart deaths and ensuring long time safety."" Dr Chanana said further that BVS is the latest innovation in the treatment after heart attack. They are also known as fourth revolution in the management of coronary artery disease. They have a unique ability to open blocked arteries, give them strength and medicine till they remain open on their own and then disappear from body. Because of its unique effect, it lets heart system to function as natural which is by far the best for healthy heart.BVS were launched in India in the year 2013.

Malaria vaccine loses effectiveness over several years: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Malaria-vaccine-loses-effectiveness-over-several-years-Study/articleshow/52982547.cms,"WASHINGTON: An experimental vaccine against malaria known as Mosquirix â€” or RTS,S â€” weakens over time and is only about four per cent effective over a seven-year span, researchers said on Wednesday.The findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, are based on a phase II clinical trial involving more than 400 young children in Kenya.There is currently no vaccine against malaria on the world market and Mosquirix â€” developed by the British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline â€” is the experimental vaccine in the most advanced stage of development.It has also been tested in a vast clinical trial that spanned seven African nations, and last year the European Medicines Agency gave it a ""positive scientific opinion"" regarding its use outside the European Union.But the current study, involving 447 children from five to 17 months of age, suggested otherwise. Some of the infants were given three doses of the malaria vaccine, while others received a vaccine against rabies for comparison.In the first year, the protection against malaria among Mosquirix-vaccinated children was 35.9 per cent. But after four years this protection fell to 2.5 percent.Researchers said that on average, over the course of seven years, the vaccine would be considered just 4.4 per cent effective against malaria. This rate ""was substantially lower than that seen over short-term follow up,"" said the study.Furthermore, among children who were more frequently exposed to mosquito-borne malaria, cases of infection with the parasite P. falciparum in the fifth year were higher than in the control group.Researchers said this phenomenon may be occurring because the vaccine protects against the earliest form of malaria's life cycle, known as sporozoites, and reduces exposure to a later form, known as the blood-stage parasite, which causes the clinical symptoms of malaria such as fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.""The reduced exposure to blood-stage parasites among persons who have received the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine may lead to a slower acquisition of immunity to blood-stage parasites, leading to an increase in episodes of clinical malaria in later life,"" said the study.The results of a larger, phase III clinical trial with the same vaccine, published last year, showed that three doses could reduce the risk of malaria by 28 per cent over a period of four years. The rate of protection rose to 36 per cent when children received a fourth dose of the vaccine, suggesting that this additional dose was significant.Malaria killed more than 400,000 people worldwide in 2015, with most of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and most among children under age five.The research was funded by the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

Because of delays among member countries for this project, which include USA, India, European Union, China, Japan, Russia and South Korea, there has been a cost escalation leading to the project currently requiring an additional $5.2 billion before it begins testing.Scientists working on the ITER are trying to create 500 megawatts of power from plasma burning at 170 million degrees celsius. The project would use only 50 megawatts of energy to cool and contain the reaction, proving the technology is a possible source of electricity and heat. Construction for the project has started in France.The European Union contributes 45% of the construction cost while the rest is split between the other six countries. Coblentz said Britain's exit from the EU would not have any impact on the future of the project."

"Growing, supermassive black hole discovered",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Growing-supermassive-black-hole-discovered/articleshow/53063429.cms,"GENEVA: Scientists have discovered a jet of cool, dense gas - with an unusual, swirling structure - which indicates the presence of a growing supermassive black hole in the centre of a galaxy located 70 million light years from Earth.Astronomers used the Alma telescope (Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array) in Chile to observe a remarkable structure in the centre of the galaxy NGC 1377, located in the constellation Eridanus.""We were curious about this galaxy because of its bright, dust-enshrouded centre. What we weren't expecting was this - a long, narrow jet streaming out from the galaxy nucleus,"" said Susanne Aalto, professor at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, who led the research.The observations with Alma unveil a jet which is 500 light years long and less than 60 light years across, travelling at speeds of at least 800,000 kilometres per hour.Most galaxies have a supermassive black hole in their centres; these black holes can have masses of between a few million to a billion solar masses.How they grew to be so massive is a long-standing mystery for scientists.A black hole's presence can be seen indirectly by telescopes when matter is falling into it - a process which astronomers call ""accretion.""Jets of fast-moving material are typical signatures that a black hole is growing by accreting matter. The jet in NGC 1377 unveils the presence of a supermassive black hole.However, it has even more to tell us, said Francesco Costagliola from Chalmers.""The jets we usually see emerging from galaxy nuclei are very narrow tubes of hot plasma. This jet is very different. Instead it's extremely cool, and its light comes from dense gas composed of molecules,"" said Costagliola.The jet has ejected molecular gas equivalent to two million times the mass of the Sun over a period of only around half a million years - a very short time in the life of a galaxy.During this short and dramatic phase in the galaxy's evolution, its central, supermassive black hole must have grown fast.""Black holes that cause powerful narrow jets can grow slowly by accreting hot plasma. The black hole in NGC 1377, on the other hand, is on a diet of cold gas and dust, and can therefore grow - at least for now - at a much faster rate,"" said Jay Gallagher from University of Wisconsin-Madison.The measurements show that the jet is precessing - swirling outwards like water from a garden sprinkler.""The jet's unusual swirling could be due to an uneven flow of gas towards the central black hole. Another possibility is that the galaxy's centre contains two supermassive black holes in orbit around each other,"" said Sebastien Muller from Chalmers.The research was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics"

Hello Jupiter! NASA spacecraft arrives at giant planet,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Hello-Jupiter-NASA-spacecraft-arrives-at-giant-planet/articleshow/53055622.cms,"PASADENA, Calif: Braving intense radiation, a NASA+ spacecraft reached Jupiter on Monday after a five-year voyage to begin exploring the king of the planets.Ground controllers at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory erupted in applause when the solar-powered Juno spacecraft beamed home news that it was circling Jupiter's poles.The arrival at Jupiter was dramatic. As Juno approached its target, it fired its rocket engine to slow itself down and gently slipped into orbit. Because of the communication time lag between Jupiter and Earth, Juno was on autopilot when it executed the daring move.The spacecraft's camera and other instruments were switched off for arrival, so there won't be any pictures at the moment it reaches its destination. Hours before the encounter, NASA released a series of images taken last week during the approach, showing Jupiter glowing yellow in the distance, circled by its four inner moons.Scientists have promised close-up views of the planet when Juno skims the cloud tops during the 20-month, $1.1 billion mission.  The fifth rock from the sun and the heftiest planet in the solar system, Jupiter is what's known as a gas giant â€” a ball of hydrogen and helium â€” unlike rocky Earth and Mars.With its billowy clouds and colorful stripes, Jupiter is an extreme world that likely formed first, shortly after the sun. Unlocking its history may hold clues to understanding how Earth and the rest of the solar system developed.Named after Jupiter's cloud-piercing wife in Roman mythology, Juno is only the second mission designed to spend time at Jupiter.Galileo, launched in 1989, circled Jupiter for nearly a decade, beaming back splendid views of the planet and its numerous moons. It uncovered signs of an ocean beneath the icy surface of the moon Europa, considered a top target in the search for life outside Earth.Juno's mission: To peer through Jupiter's cloud-socked atmosphere and map the interior from a unique vantage point above the poles. Among the lingering questions: How much water exists? Is there a solid core? Why are Jupiter's southern and northern lights the brightest in the solar system?""What Juno's about is looking beneath that surface,"" Juno chief scientist Scott Bolton said before the arrival. ""We've got to go down and look at what's inside, see how it's built, how deep these features go, learn about its real secrets.""There's also the mystery of its Great Red Spot. Recent observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed the centuries-old monster storm in Jupiter's atmosphere is shrinking.The trek to Jupiter, spanning nearly five years and 1.8 billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers), took Juno on a tour of the inner solar system followed by a swing past Earth that catapulted it beyond the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.Along the way, Juno became the first spacecraft to cruise that far out powered by the sun, beating Europe's comet-chasing Rosetta spacecraft. A trio of massive solar wings sticks out from Juno like blades from a windmill, generating 500 watts of power to run its nine instruments.In the coming days, Juno will turn its instruments back on, but the real work won't begin until late August when the spacecraft swings in closer. Plans called for Juno to swoop within 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) of Jupiter's clouds â€” closer than previous missions â€” to map the planet's gravity and magnetic fields in order to learn about the interior makeup.Juno, built by Lockheed Martin, is an armored spacecraft â€” its computer and electronics are locked in a titanium vault to shield them from harmful radiation. Even so, Juno is expected to get blasted with radiation equal to more than 100 million dental X-rays during the mission.Like Galileo before it, Juno meets its demise in 2018 when it deliberately dives into Jupiter's atmosphere and disintegrates â€” a necessary sacrifice to prevent any chance of accidentally crashing into the planet's potentially habitable moons."
Zika virus may not cause microcephaly: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Zika-virus-may-not-cause-microcephaly-Study/articleshow/52928651.cms,"NEW YORK: The number of missing cases of microcephaly epidemic in several countries raises serious questions about the assumed connection between Zika and microcephaly, finds a new study.The epidemic of microcephaly â€” a birth defect where a baby's head is smaller â€” in Brazil has raised serious questions about its assumed connection with Zika virus, a new study explains.Prenatal Zika virus infection has been linked to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, most notably microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies.In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases.A new study in Colombia found that the total number of pregnancies with Zika infections is much larger, with 11,944 cases with Zika symptoms being observed in clinical settings. But, no cases of microcephaly occurred in all of these pregnancies.However, the report cites four cases of microcephaly with Zika in the general population that did not report any Zika symptoms.This implies that there are many more cases of Zika infection that are not reported, said Yaneer Bar-Yam from the New England Complex Systems Institute in the US.The Zika and microcephaly cases that are not part of the study show that there are many more pregnancies affected by Zika without symptoms.""If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases?"" researchers asked.Until April 28, there has been a total of about 50 microcephaly cases in Colombia, of which only four have been connected with Zika, the researchers said.In light of this evidence, the cause of microcephaly in Brazil should be reconsidered, said the paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine.An alternative cause of microcephaly in Brazil could be the pesticide pyriproxyfen, which is cross-reactive with retinoic acid and is being used in drinking water, the researchers concluded."

"Rice farming dates back to China, 9000 years ago",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Rice-farming-dates-back-to-China-9000-years-ago/articleshow/52880806.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rice farming originated in China over 9000 years ago, according to new evidence unearthed by archaeologists. This pushes back the period of origin from the present estimate of about 8200 years ago, made in 2011. This discovery, made by a team of archaeologists from the University of Toronto Mississauga in Canada and the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in China. The study sheds new light on the origins of rice domestication and on the history of human agricultural practices.""Today, rice is one of most important grains in the world's economy, yet at one time, it was a wild plant...how did people bring rice into their world? This gives us another clue about how humans became farmers,"" says Gary Crawford, an anthropological archaeologist who studies the relationships between people and plants in prehistory.Working with three researchers from the Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in Zhejiang Province, China, Crawford found the ancient domesticated rice fragments in a probable ditch in the lower Yangtze valley. They observed that about 30 per cent of the rice plant material - primarily bases, husks and leaf epidermis - were not wild, but showed signs of being purposely cultivated to produce rice plants that were durable and suitable for human consumption. Crawford says this finding indicates that the domestication of rice has been going on for much longer than originally thought. The rice plant remains also had characteristics of japonica rice, the short grain rice used in sushi that today is cultivated in Japan and Korea. Crawford says this finding clarifies the lineage of this specific rice crop, and confirms for the first time that it grew in this region of China.Crawford and his colleagues spent about three years exploring the five-hectare archaeological dig site, called Huxi, which is situated in a flat basin about 100 metres above sea level. Their investigations were supported by other U of T Mississauga participants - anthropology professor David Smith and graduate students Danial Kwan and Nattha Cheunwattana. They worked primarily in early spring, fall and winter in order to avoid the late-spring wet season and excruciatingly hot summer months. Digging 1.5 metres below the ground, the team also unearthed artefacts such as sophisticated pottery and stone tools, as well as animal bones, charcoal and other plant seeds.This study builds on Crawford's previous research into early agriculture in China, in which he has examined the ancient settlements, tools, and plant and animal management efforts that occurred in different regions of the country. He is interested in better understanding the forces that compelled our human ancestors to transition from hunters and gatherers to farmers.""The question I ultimately want to answer is, what pushed them to move wholeheartedly into the farming regime? Why did they reduce their emphasis on hunting and expand into crop production?"" Crawford says. ""People did what they needed to do to make their lives more manageable and sustainable, and the unintended consequence was farming. With this rice discovery, we're seeing the first stages of that shift."" he added.The study is published in Scientific Reports, an online open-access journal from the publishers of Nature."

Volcanoes go quiet before they erupt: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Volcanoes-go-quiet-before-they-erupt-Study/articleshow/52903120.cms,"WASHINGTON: Periods of seismic quiet occur immediately before volcanic eruptions and can thus be used to forecast an impending eruption for restless volcanoes, scientists say. When dormant volcanoes are about to erupt, they show some predictive characteristics - seismic activity beneath the volcano starts to increase, gas escapes through the vent, or the surrounding ground starts to deform. However, until now, there has not been a way to forecast eruptions of more restless volcanoes because of the constant seismic activity and gas and steam emissions.Diana Roman, a volcanologist at Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS) in the US, working with a team of scientists from Pennsylvania State University, Oxford University, the University of Iceland found that periods of seismic quiet occur immediately before eruptions and can thus be used to forecast an impending eruption for restless volcanoes.The duration of the silence can indicate the level of energy that will be released when eruption occurs. Longer quiet periods mean a bigger bang. The team monitored a sequence of eruptions at the Telica Volcano in Nicaragua in 2011. It is a so-called stratovolcano, with a classic-looking cone built up by many layers of lava and ash.They started monitoring Telica in 2009 with various instruments and by 2011 they had a comprehensive network within four kilometres of the volcano's summit. The 2011 eruptive event was a month-long series of small to moderate ash explosions. Prior to the eruption, there was a lack of deep seismicity or deformation, and small changes in sulphur dioxide gas emissions, indicating that the eruption was not driven by fresh magma.Instead, the eruption likely resulted from the vents being sealed off so that gas could not escape. This resulted in an increase in the pressure that eventually caused the explosions.Of the 50 explosions that occurred, 35 had preceding quiet periods lasting 30 minutes or longer. Thirteen explosions were preceded by quiet intervals of at least five minutes. Only two of the 50 did not have any quiet period preceding the explosion.""It is the proverbial calm before the storm. The icing on the cake is that we could also use these quiet periods to forecast the amount of energy released,"" said Roman.The researchers did a ""hindsight"" analysis of the energy released and found that the longer the quiet phase preceding an explosion, the more energy was released in the ensuing explosion. The quiet periods ranged from six minutes before an explosion to over 10 hours for the largest explosion.The researchers were also able to forecast a minimum energy for impending explosions based on the data from the previous quiet/explosion pairs and the duration of the particular quiet period being analysed. The research was published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters."

The mission cost $1.1 billion dollars and launched five years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The NASA mission aims to orbit Jupiter from pole to pole, sampling its charged particles and magnetic fields for the first time and revealing more about the auroras in ultraviolet light that can be seen around the planet's polar regions.Juno should circle the planet 37 times before finally making a death plunge in 2018, to prevent the spacecraft from causing damage to any of Jupiter's icy moons, which NASA hopes to explore one day for signs of life.Although Juno will not be the first spacecraft to circle Jupiter, NASA says its orbit will bring it closer than its predecessor, Galileo, which launched in 1989.That spacecraft found evidence of subsurface saltwater on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto before making a final plunge into Jupiter in 2003.NASA says Juno should be able to get closer than Galileo -- this time within 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) above the cloud tops.""We have done everything humanly possible to make this mission a success,"" said NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green.However, ""it is still a cliffhanger for me, too."""

Nail-biting kids have less allergies,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Nail-biting-kids-have-less-allergies/articleshow/53152036.cms,"NEW DELHI: Children who suck thumbs or keep biting their nails get scolded a lot for these bad habits. But a new research has found that there is a positive side to these habits. Such children are less likely to develop common allergies to house dust mites, grass, cats, dogs, horses or airborne fungi. Children who have both habits are even less likely to have these allergies.The research, published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday, was completed by researchers of New Zealand's Dunedin School of Medicine, assisted by professor Malcolm Sears of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, who was formerly at Dunedin.""Our findings are consistent with the hygiene theory that early exposure to dirt or germs reduces the risk of developing allergies,"" said Sears. ""While we don't recommend that these habits should be encouraged, there does appear to be a positive side to these habits.""The researchers were testing the idea that the common childhood habits of thumb-sucking and nail-biting would increase microbial exposures, affecting the immune system and reducing the development of allergic reactions also known as atopic sensitization.The habits of thumb-sucking and nail-biting were measured in a longitudinal birth cohort of more than 1,000 New Zealand children at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11; and atopic sensitization was measured by skin-prick testing at 13 and 32 years old.The researchers found 31 per cent of children were frequent thumb suckers or nail biters.Among all children at 13 years old, 45% showed atopic sensitization, but among those with one oral habit, only 40% had allergies. Among those with both habits, only 31% had allergies. This trend was sustained into adulthood, and showed no difference depending on smoking in the household, ownership of cats or dogs; or exposure to house dust mites.However, the study did not find associations between the oral habits and development of asthma or hay fever."
Your parents may be to blame for job problems: Study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Your-parents-may-be-to-blame-for-job-problems-Study/articleshow/53140367.cms,"WASHINGTON: Parents, take note! If your kids have problems at work, you may be responsible to some extent for the trouble, according to a new study which found a link between parenting styles and workplace behaviour.""It really is about both parents, but because mothers are typically the primary caregivers of the children, they usually have more influence on their children,"" said Peter Harms from University of Alabama in the US.Researchers studied manager-employee relationships in the workplace and found a link between parenting styles and workplace behaviour.Their research was based on the work of John Bowlby, an early psychoanalyst, who argued that the way parents treat their offspring could have long-term implications for how their children approach relationships.In particular, the work focused on how parents acted when their infants cried out for help.""You will see this in almost any parenting book you buy. Should you let the baby cry, or should you rush to comfort them,"" said Harms.Babies learn over time that when they feel abandoned or threatened they can either count on their parent to come to their rescue right away or they need to escalate to high levels of distress in order to get attention.Or, if babies learn that parents are not a reliable source of comfort, they stop making overt appeals for help.Individuals with reliable parents view others as potential sources of support. Those individuals with unreliable parents tend not to see parents as sources of support, researchers said.These people are often categorised as having anxious or avoidant attachment depending on the style they adopted to cope with distress, they said.""Anxiously attached people genuinely want to be loved, but they are nervous that the important people in their lives will not return their affection,"" said Harms.""They overreact anytime they think their relationships are threatened. They use guilt and extreme emotional displays so that others will stay near and reassure them. They get really upset and cannot turn it off,"" Harms said.""On the other hand, avoidant people feel, 'I do not want to love you, and you do not need to love me. So just leave me alone.' You will not find these people weeping over broken relationships,"" he added.Researchers speculated that individuals may transfer this pattern of thinking into the workplace and, in particular, that it may influence one's relationship with one's boss.""Your boss is sort of like your parent. They are the ones who can take care of you, they are supposed to train you and support you. This is especially true for individuals new to the workforce,"" said Harms.The findings showed that when anxious followers were paired with supportive leaders, they were perfectly fine.But when they were paired with distant, unsupportive leaders, the anxiously attached employees reported higher levels of stress and lower levels of performance.The study was published in the journal Human Relations."

'Selfie elbow' becoming new medical condition,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Selfie-elbow-becoming-new-medical-condition/articleshow/53053672.cms,"NEW YORK: Doctors have warned that capturing that perfect selfie can put avid selfietakers at risk of developing ""selfie elbow"", which is becoming a medical condition.Like tennis elbow or golfer's elbow, an addiction to taking selfies can cause a pain in the primary elbow and there has been a spurt in patients landing in the doctor's office with the contion.According to Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine physician at Hospital for Special Surgery in the US, the problem is overuse. Like carpal tunnel and tendinitis, it is the repetitive nature of the task that causes the aches. If you do something enough times - typing, texting, or taking selfies - it is going to have consequences.""Basically, the interface between technology and the human body sometimes causes injuries of over-exuberance,"" Metzl said, adding, ""We used to see it with Blackberry phones -it was a real thing. People would get tendinitis in their thumb because they were on their Blackberries all the time.""Explaining the problem, Metzl said, ""You put too much stress on the muscle and it irritates the area where the muscle comes off the bone and you get this inflammatory response."" The condition can be treated by taking pain relievers like Advil or Motrin for the inflammation and putting on some ice as well as stretching the muscles.The condition is an addition to the long list of concerns about the increase in technology injuries in teens. Gaming, using Snapchat, selfie-taking, texting and tweeting teens are more prone to overuse injuries than ever before.In a recent case, award winning journalist Hoda Kotb went to a doctor complaining of pain in her elbow. ""I went to the orthopaedist and he said, `are you playing tennis or ping-pong?' I told him I was taking selfies,"" Kotb was quoted as saying.""In recent years we've been seeing an increase in carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis from overuse in teens, where 10 to 15 years ago it was mostly scraped knees and falling off a bike,"" said Charles Kim, a musculoskeletal rehab specialist at Rusk Rehabilitation at New York University Langone Medical Centre.Kim suggests a selfie stick for the dedicated documenters, which works like an arm extender and takes the pressure off the elbow."

Last year, the researchers mixed inedible parts of the 2013 plants into the simulant and succeeded to grow ten different crops, of which several were harvested.One remaining uncertainty was that heavy metals such as cadmium, copper and lead, which are present in the soils, could contaminate the crops.If too high levels of heavy metals from the soil are absorbed in the edible parts of the plants, the crops become poisonous.The researchers have now tested four of the ten grown crops for heavy metals: radishes, peas, rye, and tomatoes. No dangerous levels of aluminium, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, chrome, nickel and lead were found, meaning the four crops are safe to eat.""These remarkable results are very promising,"" said senior ecologist Wieger Wamelink.""We can actually eat the radishes, peas, rye, and tomatoes and I am very curious what they will taste like,"" Wamelink said.For some of the heavy metals the concentrations in the plants were even lower than in the crops grown in potting soil.""It's important to test as many crops as possible, to make sure that settlers on Mars have access to a broad variety of different food sources,"" he said.The crops are not only tested for heavy metals, but also for vitamins, flavonoids and alkaloids."

Pomegranate's anti-aging properties revealed by scientists,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Pomegranates-anti-aging-properties-revealed-by-scientists/articleshow/53170774.cms,"How true is it that pomegranates are good for health and contribute to a longer life? Although part of folk wisdom, there was no scientific proof for this fruit's acclaimed properties. Now, scientists have discovered that pomegranate have a substance that is transformed by microbes in the gut into a very effective anti-aging trigger.A team of scientists from EPFL and the company Amazentis found that pomegranates have the precursor to a molecule called urolithin A. When this precursor reaches the digestive system, microbes living there process it producing urolithin A. This is an essential substance for preventing the breakdown of mitochondria, the powerhouses that run our cells. As we age, defunct mitochondria accumulate in cells causing degradation of muscles, weakening them over years. Urolithin A can reverse this process.""It's the only known molecule that can relaunch the mitochondrial clean-up process, otherwise known as mitophagy,"" says Patrick Aebischer, co-author on the study. ""It's a completely natural substance, and its effect is powerful and measurable.""Experiments have been done till now on a type of worm well suited for such experiments, and on rats. Human clinical trials are currently underway, but these initial findings have already been published in the journal Nature Medicine.The team started out by testing their hypothesis on the nematode C. elegans. It's a favorite test subject among aging experts, because after just 8-10 days it's already considered elderly. The lifespan of worms exposed to urolithin A increased by more than 45% compared with the control group.These initial encouraging results led the team to test the molecule on animals that have more in common with humans. In the rodent studies, like with C. elegans, a significant reduction in the number of mitochondria was observed, indicating that a robust cellular recycling process was taking place. Older mice, around two years of age, showed 42% better endurance while running than equally old mice in the control group.Before heading out to stock up on pomegranates, however, it's worth noting that the fruit doesn't itself contain the miracle molecule, but rather its precursor. That molecule is converted into urolithin A by the microbes that inhabit the intestine. Because of this, the amount of urolithin A produced can vary widely, depending on the species of animal and the flora present in the gut microbiome. Some individuals don't produce any at all. If you're one of the unlucky ones, it's possible that pomegranate juice won't do you any good.For those without the right microbes in their guts, however, the scientists are already working on a solution. The study's co-authors founded a start-up company, Amazentis, which has developed a method to deliver finely calibrated doses of urolithin A. The company is currently conducting first clinical trials testing the molecule in humans in European hospitals."

Robots to swim in Bay of Bengal for monsoon study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Robots-to-swim-in-Bay-of-Bengal-for-monsoon-study/articleshow/52747822.cms,"NEW DELHI: To better understand and predict South Asia's seasonal monsoon, scientists are getting ready to release robots in the Bay of Bengal in a study of how ocean conditions might affect rainfall patterns.The monsoon, which hits between June and September, delivers more than 70% of India's annual rainfall. Its arrival is eagerly awaited by hundreds of millions of subsistence farmers, and delays can ruin crops or exacerbate drought.Yet, the rains are hard to predict and depend on the complex interplay between global atmospheric and oceanic movements in ways not yet fully understood. They can be affected by weather phenomena such as El Nino, and could become even more erratic with climate change and even air pollution.""It's such a complex system,"" said oceanographer Ben Webber at the University of East Anglia's School of Environmental Sciences, the UK university leading the $11 million project. Still, ""the processes that occur in the Bay of Bengal are not well understood.""One of the biggest mysteries is how the water currents work, with colder and fresher water streaming into the northern part of the bay, while warmer and saltier water flows in further south from the Arabian Sea. The colder water tends to stay at the surface, while warmer saline water swirls in below. But as the two masses mix, the warmer water moves toward the surface and releases heat and moisture, which then powers atmospheric storms.While scientists have known that small changes in the water's surface temperatures can have a big impact, they have never thoroughly studied those temperature changes during the monsoon season â€” partly because working from a ship during severe weather involves navigating strong winds and high waves.""We don't know what we're going to find. There's been so little observation,"" Webber said. ""We may confirm what we think theoretically. But we really don't know. It's quite exciting.""Working from an Indian research ship departing the southern port city of Chennai later this month, the British scientists will spend a month at sea releasing seven underwater robots across a 400-kilometer (250-mile) stretch of water. The torpedo-shaped robots are programed to navigate up and down through the water to a depth of 1,000 meters (3,280 feet), measuring the water salinity, temperature and current and transmitting the data to a satellite.At the same time, scientists from the University of Reading and the Indian government in a related study will take atmospheric measurements.By comparing the two sets of data, scientists hope to better understand how ocean conditions affect monsoon patterns.This year's monsoon arrived at the southernmost tip of the subcontinent on June 8 â€” a week later than usual â€” and has been slow in moving north and relieving a drought devastating wide swathes of central, eastern and northern India.On Tuesday, Indian Meteorological Department officials advised farmers in Maharashtra to delay planting seeds for their next crops until the rains reached the parched central state, which they said would likely happen after Thursday. About 18 percent of the country's economy comes from agriculture.""Do not undertake sowing operations till the onset of monsoon,"" the deputy head of the department's agricultural meteorology division N. Chattopadhyay told reporters in order to convey the advice to farmers. ""It is necessary to have good monsoon rainfall consistently for a few days for the seeds to grow into a good crop.""The rains were predicted to reach the capital of New Delhi around July 1.After the government started a program in 2012 to improve its monsoon predictions, it plans to spend at least $43 million through 2017 improving its technology and computing capability for more accurate calculations and models of seasonal weather forecasts, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences.""We need to better understand how the monsoon works,"" said meteorologist D.P. Yadav, who works on monsoon forecasts for the government. ""Most of our states' economies depend on it. It is the most important weather event for India."""
Melting Greenland ice linked to faster Arctic warming,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Melting-Greenland-ice-linked-to-faster-Arctic-warming/articleshow/52692676.cms,"WASHINGTON: Scientists have found the first evidence that links melting ice in Greenland to Arctic amplification, faster warming of the Arctic compared to the rest of the Northern Hemisphere as sea ice disappears.The findings show that the predicted effects of Arctic amplification, as described in previous studies, occurred over northern Greenland during summer last year, including a northern swing of the jet stream that reached latitudes never before recorded in Greenland at that time of year.The Greenland ice sheet, Earth's second largest after Antarctica, holds enough ice that if it were to melt entirely, it would raise average global sea level by about 7 metres.Learning more about the drivers of melting is essential to discerning how much sea level will rise and by how much in the future and how Greenland's freshwater runoff will affect ocean circulation and ecology.""During the past two decades, we have seen increasing melt from the Greenland ice sheet, culminating in a very large melt event in the summer of 2012,"" said Thomas Mote, professor at University of Georgia in the US.""Last year was unique in the extensive melting that occurred on the northern reaches of the ice sheet, an area that usually has rather modest melt compared to southern Greenland.""We identified an unusual configuration of the jet stream toward northern Greenland that led to this melt pattern,"" said Mote.Rising global temperatures are melting Arctic sea ice, leaving dark open water that absorbs more solar radiation and causes faster warming in the Arctic.While Arctic amplification is well documented, its effects on the atmosphere are still debated. One theory among scientists is that the shrinking temperature difference between the Arctic and the temperate zone will lead to a slowing of the jet stream.Normally, when the jet stream circles the northern latitudes, the frigid polar air is separated from warmer air in the south.Slower winds, however, could create wilder swings that would allow warm, humid air to penetrate farther north.The study was published in the journal Nature Communications."
Gravitational waves detected for a second time,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Gravitational-waves-detected-for-a-second-time/articleshow/52773469.cms,"CAPE CANAVERAL: The ground-breaking detection of gravitational waves, ripples in space and time postulated by Albert Einstein 100 years ago, that was announced in February was no fluke. Scientists said on Wednesday that they have spotted them for a second time.The researchers said they detected gravitational waves that washed over Earth after two distant black holes spiraled toward each other and merged into a single, larger abyss 1.4 billion years ago. That long-ago violent collision set off reverberations through spacetime, a fusion of the concepts of time and three-dimensional space.These gravitational waves were observed by twin observatories in the United States late on December 25, 2015. The detectors are located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington.The first detection of gravitational waves was made in September and announced on February 11. It created a scientific sensation and was a benchmark in physics and astronomy, transforming a quirky implication of Einstein's 1916 theory of gravity into the realm of observational astronomy.The waves detected in September and December both were triggered by the merger of black holes, which are regions so dense with matter that not even photons of light can escape the gravitational sinkholes they produce in space.The merging black holes that set space ringing in December were much smaller than the first pair, demonstrating the sensitivity of the recently upgraded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory, or LIGO, facilities.""We are starting to get a glimpse of the kind of new astrophysical information that can only come from gravitational-wave detectors,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher David Shoemaker.The black holes that triggered the newly detected gravitational waves were eight and 14 times more massive than the sun, respectively, before merging into a single, spinning black hole about 21 times more massive than the sun. The equivalent of one sun's worth of mass was transformed into gravitational energy.The Louisiana site detected the waves first and the Washington state detector picked up the signal 1.1 milliseconds later. Scientists can use the timing difference to calculate a rough idea of where the black holes merger occurred.Scientists say the second detection confirms that pairs of black holes are relatively common.""Now that we are able to detect gravitational waves, they are going to be a phenomenal source of new information about our galaxy and an entirely new channel for discoveries about the universe,"" Pennsylvania State University astrophysicist Chad Hanna said.The research, presented at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San Diego, will be published in the journal Physical Review Letters."
New space rock to reveal origin of life on Earth,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-space-rock-to-reveal-origin-of-life-on-Earth/articleshow/52779279.cms,"NEW YORK: Scientists have discovered an ancient space rock which can reportedly shed more light on the evolution of life. The meteorite, discovered in Sweden's fossil meteorite-rich Thorsberg quarry, belongs to a type that has never before been found on the Earth.The new meteorite, called Ost 65, appears to be from the missing partner in a massive asteroid collision 470 million years ago.The collision sent debris falling to the Earth over about a million years and may have influenced a great diversification of life in the Ordovician Period which lasted almost 45 million years, beginning 488.3 million years ago and ending 443.7 million years ago.One of the objects involved in this collision is well-known. It was the source of L-chondrites, the most common type of meteorite. But the identity of the object that hit it has been a mystery.""In our entire civilisation, we have collected over 50,000 meteorites and no one has seen anything like this one before,"" said study co-author Qing-zhu Yin, professor of geochemistry and planetary sciences at University of California-Davis. ""Discovering a new type of meteorite is very, very exciting.""Measuring just under four-inches wide, it looks like a gray cow patty plopped into a pristine layer of fossil-rich pink limestone.By measuring how long Ost 65 was exposed to cosmic rays, the team established that it travelled in space for about a million years before it fell to the Earth 470 million years ago. This timeline matches up with L-chondrite meteorites found in the quarry.According to the researchers, about 100 times as many meteorites slammed into the Earth during the Ordovician Period compared with today owing to the massive collision in the asteroid belt.This rain of meteorites may have opened new environmental niches for organisms, thus boosting both the diversity and complexity of life on Earth.""I think this shows the interconnectedness of the entire solar system in space and time, that a random collision 470 million years ago in the asteroid belt, could dictate the evolutionary path of species here on Earth,"" Yin explained."

India sets new record in space mission; PSLV C34 successfully injects 20 satellites into orbit,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/India-sets-new-record-in-space-mission-PSLV-C34-successfully-injects-20-satellites-into-orbit/articleshow/52862382.cms,"CHENNAI: India took a big leap in space technology on Wednesday when Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)+ used its workhorse PSLV-C34 to inject 20 satellites including 17 foreign satellites into orbit in a single mission and set a new record on Wednesday.The 320-tonne Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C34) took off on its 36th flight at 9.26am from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre with 20 satellites including its primary payload Cartosat-2 series, which provides remote sensing services, and earth observation and imaging satellites from US, Canada, Germany and Indonesia. It was also 14th flight of PSLV in 'XL'configuration with the use of solid strap-on motors.Cartosat-2 was placed in orbit at 9.44am. With Cartosat-2 weighing 727.5kg, PSLV lifted off a total of 1,288kg in to space and began placing the satellites into orbit about 17minutes later.In the final stages of the mission, ISRO also demonstrated the vehicle's capability to place satellites in different orbits. In the demonstration, the vehicle reignited twice after its fourth and final stage and moved further a few kilometres into another orbit.ISRO scientists said the demonstration is for their next mission when they are planning to inject satellites in different orbits using a single rocket.ISRO set a world record for the highest number of satellites launched in a single mission when it placed 10 satellites in a PSLV on April 28, 2008. Nasa in 2013 placed 29 satellites in a single mission and Russia in 2014 launched 33 satellites in one launch.In December 2015, when PSLV-C29 injected six Singapore satellites in to orbit, ISRO conducted a major experiment where the fourth stage was reignited and switched off after the satellites were placed in orbit.ISRO scientists said, the vehicle had been pre-programmed for today's launch+ to perform tiny manoeuvring to place the 20 satellites into polar sun-synchronous orbits with different inclinations and velocities. It ensured that the satellites were placed with enough distance to prevent collision.ISRO began launching foreign satellites on board PSLV in May 1999. Since then, it has gained popularity, as it launched foreign satellites successfully using PSLV by charging only 60% of the fee charged by foreign space agencies. It has so far launched 57 foreign satellites.Apart from Cartosat-2, the satellites launched on Wednesday include Lapan-A3 from Indonesia, Biros from Germany, M3MSat from Canada, SkySat Gen2-1, a Google-made satellite from USA, GHGSat-D from Canada, 12 Dove satellites from USA, Sathyabamasat from Sathyabhama University, Chennai and Swayam from College of Engineering, Pune.Read this story in Marathi"
"Art making reduces stress, even for beginners",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Art-making-reduces-stress-even-for-beginners/articleshow/52763237.cms,"NEW DELHI: Making art can significantly reduce stress-related hormones in your body even if you have no practice or flair for it, a new study has found. Everyone seems to benefit equally from the activity's stress-reducing effects researchers of Drexel University's College of Nursing and Health Professions found. The results of the study were published in the journal Art Therapy.""It was surprising and it also wasn't,"" said Girija Kaimal, assistant professor of creative arts therapies. ""It wasn't surprising because that's the core idea in art therapy: Everyone is creative and can be expressive in the visual arts when working in a supportive setting. That said, I did expect that perhaps the effects would be stronger for those with prior experience.""For Kaimal's study, 39 adults, ranging from 18 to 59 years old, were invited to participate in 45 minutes of art-making. Less than half the participants had limited prior experience in art making. Materials available to the participants included markers and paper, modeling clay and collage materials. There were no directions given and every participant could use any of the materials they chose to create any work of art they desired.Stress levels were checked by taking their saliva samples and measuring its cortisol levels before and after the art-making period. The higher a person's cortisol level, the more stressed a person is likely to be.The researchers found that 75 percent of the participants' cortisol levels lowered during their 45 minutes of making art. And while there was some variation in how much cortisol levels lowered, there was no correlation between past art experiences and lower levels.Written testimonies of their experiences afterward revealed how the participants felt about the creating art.""It was very relaxing,"" one wrote. ""After about five minutes, I felt less anxious. I was able to obsess less about things that I had not done or need[ed] to get done. Doing art allowed me to put things into perspective.""However, roughly 25 percent of the participants actually registered higher levels of cortisolâ€”though that wasn't necessarily a bad thing.""Some amount of cortisol is essential for functioning,"" Kaimal explained. ""For example, our cortisol levels vary throughout the dayâ€”levels are highest in the morning because that gives us an energy boost to us going at the start of the day. It could've been that the art-making resulted in a state of arousal and/or engagement in the study's participants.""Contrary to Kaimal's belief, no significant correlation was found between the type of art materials used by participants and cortisol levels. The study did find a weak correlation between age and lower cortisol levels. Younger participants exhibited consistently lower cortisol levels after they'd created art."
"Cells that made humans possible evolved via 'long, slow dance'",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Cells-that-made-humans-possible-evolved-via-long-slow-dance/articleshow/52808960.cms,"BANGALORE: The cells that have led to the rise of the most complex life forms on earth, including multi-cellular organisms such as animals or plants, probably evolved as a result of growing intimacy between their single-celled relatives, say researchers including one from Bangalore's National Centre for Biological Sciences.The first living beings on earth were single-cell organisms. Those cells were quite simple, but during the course of evolution they gave way to a more complex cellular lineage - the eukaryotes, or cells with a nucleus.The first eukaryote is thought to have arisen when prokaryotes - the kingdoms of archaea and bacteria - joined forces. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that have no cell nucleus.But in an Opinion paper published in the journal Trends in Cell Biology, researchers have now proposed that the molecular machinery essential to eukaryotic life was probably borrowed, little by little over time, from those simpler ancestors.""We are beginning to think of eukaryotic origins as a slow process of growing intimacy - the result of a long, slow dance between kingdoms, and not a quick tryst, which is the way it is portrayed in textbooks,"" said Mukund Thattai from National Centre for Biological Sciences.The proposal is based on new genomic evidence derived from a deep-sea vent on the ocean floor.The eukaryotic cells of plants, animals, and protists are markedly different from those of their single-celled, prokaryotic relatives, the archaea and bacteria.Eukaryotic cells are much larger and have considerably more internal complexity, including many internal membrane-bound compartments.Although scientists generally agree that eukaryotes can trace their ancestry to a merger between archaea and bacteria, there has been considerable disagreement about what the first eukaryote and its immediate ancestors must have looked like.As Thattai and his colleagues Buzz Baum and Gautam Dey of University College London explained in their paper, that uncertainty has stemmed in large part from the lack of known intermediates that bridge the gap in size and complexity between prokaryotic precursors and eukaryotes.As a result, they said, the origin of the first eukaryotic cell has remained ""one of the most enduring mysteries in modern biology.""That began to change last year with the discovery of DNA sequences for an organism, that no one has ever actually seen, living near a deep-sea vent on the ocean floor.The genome of the archaeon known as Lokiarchaeum ('Loki' for short) contains more ""eukaryotic signature proteins"" (ESPs) than any other prokaryote.Importantly, among those eukaryotic signature proteins are proteins critical for eukaryotes' ability to direct traffic amongst all those inter-cellular compartments.""The genome can be seen as 'primed' for eukaryogenesis. With the acquisition of a number of key genes and lipids from a bacterial symbiont, it would be possible for Loki-type cells to evolve a primitive membrane trafficking machinery and compartmentalisation,"" Baum said.The researchers predict that, when Loki is finally isolated or cultured, ""it will look more like an archaeon than a proto-eukaryote and will not have internal compartments or a vesicle-trafficking network.""But its morphology and/or cell cycle might have complexities more often associated with eukaryotes, they noted."

"Aliens may take 1,500 more years to contact Earth: Study",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Aliens-may-take-1500-more-years-to-contact-Earth-Study/articleshow/52809999.cms,"NEW YORK: Aliens may take another 1,500 years to contact us as Earth's physical attributes are not unique making it difficult for the extra-terrestrials to locate us, a new study has found.""We haven't heard from aliens yet, as space is a big place - but that doesn't mean no one is out there,"" said Evan Solomonides, from the Cornell University in the US.""It's possible to hear any time at all, but it becomes likely we will have heard around 1,500 years from now,"" said Solomonides.""Until then, it is possible that we appear to be alone - even if we are not. But if we stop listening or looking, we may miss the signals. So we should keep looking,"" he said.Astronomers from Cornell University deconstructed the Fermi Paradox and paired it with the Mediocrity Principle into a fresh equation.According to the Fermi Paradox, billions of Earth-like planets exist in our galaxy, yet no aliens have contacted or visited us. Thus the paradox: the cosmos teems with possibility.The mediocrity principle - proposed by 16th-century mathematician Copernicus - states that the Earth's physical attributes are not unique, as natural processes are likely common throughout the cosmos, and therefore aliens would not discover us for a while.Hunting for extraterrestrials means sending out signals like television broadcasts, for example. As Earth's electronic ambassador, TV and radio signals are sent into space as a byproduct of broadcasting.These signals have been travelling from Earth for 80 years at the speed of light.For aliens receiving these transmissions, they would likely be indecipherable, said Solomonides, as the extraterrestrials would need to decode light waves into sounds, then parse 3,000 human languages to grasp the message.Earth's broadcast signals have reached every star within about 80 light years from the Sun - about 8,531 stars and 3,555 Earth-like planets, as our Milky Way galaxy alone contains 200 billion stars, researchers said.Combining the equations for the Fermi Paradox and the mediocrity principle, the researchers suggest that the Earth might hear from an alien civilization when about half of the Milky Way Galaxy has been signalled in about 1,500 years."
Scientists find giant new planet orbiting two suns,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Scientists-find-giant-new-planet-orbiting-two-suns/articleshow/52740462.cms,"WASHINGTON: Astronomers have discovered the largest planet outside our solar system orbiting two stars, at a distance that would make it potentially habitable for people, scientists announced today.A team of NASA astronomers that made the discovery using the Kepler space telescope revealed the findings at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Diego, California.The gaseous planet -- dubbed Kepler-1647 b -- is the size of Jupiter and has a wide orbit, revolving around its two stars in 1,107 days, or around three years.The discovery is the eleventh of its kind since 2005.Planets that orbit two stars- known as circumbinary planets- are sometimes called ""Tatooines,"" after the similar fictional planet in the movie Star Wars where Luke Skywalker was raised.Kepler-1647 b is further from its two stars than any other known circumbinary planet, placing it in an orbit that ""puts the planet within the so-called habitable zone,"" a statement from San Diego State University (SDSU) said.In theory, that would make the planet neither too hot nor too cold for human habitation, and water could exist in liquid form.However, Kepler-1647 b is gaseous like Jupiter, making the possibility life could exist there unlikely.Still, any large moons orbiting the planet could possibly host life.At 4.4 billion years old, Kepler-1647 b is roughly the same age as the Earth. Its stars are also similar to the Sun, one slightly larger and the other slightly smaller, according to a research paper set to appear in The Astrophysical Journal.Located near the Cygnus constellation, the planet lies some 3,700 light-years away from the Earth (a light-year is the equivalent of around 5.9 billion miles, or 9.5 billion kilometers).Researchers are able to detect planets outside the solar system- called exoplanets- when they pass in front of their stars, causing ""slight dips in brightness,"" the researchers said.""But finding circumbinary planets is much harder than finding planets around single stars,"" co-author William Welsh, an SDSU astronomer, said. ""The transits are not regularly spaced in time and they can vary in duration and even depth.""Researchers who detect potential exoplanets use advanced computer software to verify the discoveries, a typically long and arduous process.Astronomer Laurance Doyle of the SETI Institute- whose mission is to ""search for extraterrestrial intelligence""- first noticed Kepler-1647 b's transit in 2011.Scientists required several years to collect and analyze additional data before they could confirm the planet's discovery."
Oldest plant root stem cells discovered,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Oldest-plant-root-stem-cells-discovered/articleshow/52583431.cms,"LONDON: Scientists have discovered the oldest known population of plant root stem cells in a 320 million- year-old fossil, providing a window into how ancient roots developed.  The research marks the first time an actively growing fossilised root has been discovered - in effect, an ancient plant frozen in time.  The cells, which gave rise to the roots of an ancient plant, were found in a fossilised root tip at Oxford University in the UK.  ""I was examining one of the fossilised soil slides as part of my research into the rooting systems of ancient trees when I noticed a structure that looked like the living root tips we see in plants today,"" said Alexander Hetherington, a PhD student at Oxford.  ""I began to realize that I was looking at a population of 320 million-year-old plant stem cells preserved as they were growing - and that it was the first time anything like this had ever been found,"" said Hetherington.  ""It gives us a unique window into how roots developed hundreds of millions of years ago,"" he said.  Stem cells - self-renewing cells responsible for the formation of multicellular organisms - are located in plants at the tips of shoots and roots in groups called meristems.  The 320 million-year-old stem cells are different to all those living today, with a unique pattern of cell division that remained unknown until now.  That tells us that some of the mechanisms controlling root formation in plants and trees have now become extinct and may have been more diverse than thought.  These roots were important because they comprised the rooting structures of the plants growing in the Earth's first global tropical wetland forests with tall trees over 50m in height and were in part responsible for one of the most dramatic climate change events in history.  The evolution of deep rooting systems increased the rate of chemical weathering of silicate minerals in rocks - a chemical reaction that pulled carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, leading to the cooling of the Earth and thus one of the planet's great ice ages.  The fossils studied during this research are the remains of the soil from the first giant tropical rainforests on Earth.  The rock in which the soil is preserved formed in the Carboniferous swamps that gave rise to the coal sources spanning what is now Appalachia to central Europe, including the coal fields in Wales, northern England and Scotland.  ""These fossils demonstrate how the roots of these ancient plants grew for the first time,"" said Liam Dolan, professor at Oxford University.  ""This discovery also shows the importance of collections such as the Oxford University Herbaria - they are so valuable, and we need to maintain them for future generations,"" Dolan said.  The study is published in the journal Current Biology."
"Coffee no longer possible carcinogen, but 'very hot' beverages may cause cancer: WHO",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Coffee-no-longer-possible-carcinogen-but-very-hot-beverages-may-cause-cancer-WHO/articleshow/52762441.cms,"LONDON: The World Health Organization's research arm has downgraded its classification of coffee as a possible carcinogen+ , declaring there isn't enough proof to show a link to cancer.But the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or IARC, also announced in a report published on Wednesday that drinking ""very hot"" beverages of any kind could potentially raise the cancer risk, and it classified them as ""probably carcinogenic"" to humans.In particular, it cited countries including China, Iran and those in South America, where teas such as the bitter herbal infusion mate are traditionally drunk at extremely high temperatures â€” above 65 or 70 degrees Celsius (150 or 160 Fahrenheit) â€” considerably hotter than drinks would normally be served in cafes across North America and Europe.Experts convened by the Lyon-based IARC concluded that there was inadequate evidence to suggest  coffee+ might cause cancer, according to a letter published in the Lancet Oncology.""I'm not really sure why coffee was in a higher category in the first place,'' said Owen Yang, an epidemiologist at Oxford University who has previously studied the possible link between coffee and cancer. He was not part of the IARC expert group. ""The best evidence available suggests that coffee does not raise the cancer risk,"" he said.Drinking very hot beverages, however, just might.Dana Loomis, deputy head of the IARC program that classifies carcinogens, said they began to look into a possible link after seeing unusually high rates of esophageal cancer in countries where drinking very hot beverages is common. He said that even at temperatures below 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit), hot beverages can scald the skin, and that consuming drinks at even higher temperatures could be harmful.Loomis said very hot beverages might cause a ""thermal injury"" in the throat that could eventually promote the growth of tumors, but that evidence was limited. He said there wasn't enough evidence to suggest if eating very hot food might also be risky.Other experts said that people should remain focused on the leading causes of cancers+ including of the esophagus and that there were more important changes they could make other than waiting for their drinks to cool.""Quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption are much more significant for reducing cancer risk than the temperature of what you're drinking,'' said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Brawley said the cancer risk posed by drinking hot beverages was similar to that posed by eating pickled vegetables.Still, he welcomed the news that coffee would no longer be deemed a possible carcinogen.""As a heavy coffee drinker, I have always enjoyed my coffee guilt-free,'' he said. ``But now there is scientific evidence to justify that."""
'Deep-sea robot to join search for Egyptair wreck from Friday',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Deep-sea-robot-to-join-search-for-Egyptair-wreck-from-Friday/articleshow/52675569.cms,"PARIS: A research vessel with an underwater robot is set to begin searching the Mediterranean ""as from Friday"" for the wreck of the EgyptAir plane that crashed last month, according to the French aviation safety agency BEA.Egypt has hired the ""John Lethbridge"", which is owned by the private Deep Ocean Search company, to comb the ocean floor for the Airbus A320 that went down with 66 people aboard en route from Paris to Cairo on May 19.The ship is en route and ""should arrive in the area as from Friday,"" BEA director Remi Jouty told reporters.A French navy vessel using deep-water listening devices picked up signals from one of the black boxes over a week ago, but so far it has failed to locate either it or the second recorder.""For the moment we are hopeful of managing to locate these recorders while they continue to emit (pings),"" Jouty said, acknowledging ""we have to be quick"".The the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have enough battery power to emit signals for four to five weeks.The area where the plane went down is believed to be about 3,000 metres deep.The ""John Lethbridge"" has a side scan sonar that provides digital images of the seabed, as well as a robot that is capable of diving to 3,000 metres.Some wreckage was retrieved from the Mediterranean last month, along with belongings of passengers on board flight MS804, but no bodies have been found so far.The plane crashed between the Greek island of Crete and the Egyptian coast after disappearing suddenly from radar screens.Investigators have said it is too soon to determine what caused the disaster.While speculation initially centred on a terror attack, a technical fault has also not been ruled out, with automated messages sent by the plane shortly before its demise indicating smoke in the cabin and a fault in the flight control unit.The crash took place seven months after the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt's restive Sinai Peninsula in October that killed all 224 people on board.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for that attack. There has been no such claim over the EgyptAir crash."
Vet varsity researchers isolate multi-drug resistant molecules from buffaloes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Vet-varsity-researchers-isolate-multi-drug-resistant-molecules-from-buffaloes/articleshow/52782865.cms,"KOCHI: Researchers at the Kerala veterinary and animal sciences university have identified antimicrobial peptides as promising molecules to be developed as drugs against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Across the world there is a lot of work happening on developing solutions for drug-resistant bacteria.KVASU officials said that the emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes (MDRs) and chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells are causing serious havoc in health care sector and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold the promise to tackle this problem.""We have isolated a messenger RNA from buffalo and developed a protein which has an anti-microbial motif. Bovines, especially buffalox, are only seen in this part of the world and they are usually disease resistant,"" said Dr. Varuna P Panicker, assistant professor, KVASU, who isolated the molecule.They can be used as a component in targeted medicines, she said. Traditional antibiotics generally target a particular physiological process of bacteria, such as cell wall synthesis, DNA replication etc. whereas, antimicrobial peptides mostly act without specific receptors and are ideal molecules to overcome the development of resistance.AMPs are a group of evolutionary conserved and relatively short molecules (12-100 amino acids) of the immune system, which are found in all forms of life ranging from microbes to humans, to combat microbial challenge. These molecules can either be isolated from natural sources or designed and synthesized based on the template of natural peptides. ""While humans have only one such peptide, animals have many,"" he said.The project 'Molecular studies on myeloid antimicrobial peptides in buffalo' identified genes of three such peptides from the buffalo bone marrow. All the peptides were tested for its antimicrobial activity such as, antibacterial (including MDR bacteria), antifungal, antiviral, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancerous property. Their antimicrobial activity was excellent with least cytotoxicity at its treatment dose and can be developed as promising drug molecules, she said."
Why boys do better in science exam than girls explained,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Why-boys-do-better-in-science-exam-than-girls-explained/articleshow/52603131.cms,"WASHINGTON: Male students may perform better than females in life science exams not because they have better academic ability, but due to the way the questions are designed, according to a new research.  The study also found that high socio-economic status students perform better than lower-status students on the same tests.  Researchers from Arizona State University (ASU) in the US found that females and males do equally well on exams that require mostly memorization. The same holds true for low- and high-socio-economic status students.  However, when tests include cognitively challenging questions that require elevated critical thinking, females and lower socio-economic students score lower than their male or high-status peers, even though the students have equal academic ability, researchers said.  Over a three-year period, researchers looked at 87 undergraduate introductory biology exams taught by 26 instructors at a public research university. They included over 4,800 students in the analysis.  ""At first glance, one might assume the differences in exam performance are based on academic ability. However, we controlled for this in our study by including the students' incoming grade point averages in our analysis,"" said Christian Wright from ASU.  ""We were surprised to find that this gap emerged based on cognitive challenge level, and that this negatively affected women and lower socioeconomic students,"" said Wright.  Researchers recommend using active learning practices to help close the gap, including clickers, classroom discussion and other tools known to enhance student learning and help students perform better on critical thinking questions.  According to Wright, psychological factors such as stereotype threat, which can impact cognitive load, or students having growth or fixed mindsets may be the reason why a gap emerges when they take more challenging exams that test critical thinking.  The findings were published in the journal CBE-Life Sciences Education."

El Nino pushes CO2 levels beyond 400 ppm mark,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/El-Nino-pushes-CO2-levels-beyond-400-ppm-mark/articleshow/52742154.cms,"NEW DELHI: In 2016, for the first time in human history, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will be above 400 parts per million all year round as recorded at the iconic Mauna Loa, Hawaii measuring station. This is because El Nino has given an extra boost to the already rising CO2 levels, say climate scientists in a paper published in today's edition of the journal Nature Climate Change.""The atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is rising year-on-year due to human emissions, but this year, it is getting an extra boost due to the recent El Nino event - changes in the sea-surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean. This warms and dries tropical ecosystems, reducing their uptake of carbon, and exacerbating forest fires. Since human emissions are now 25 per cent greater than in the last big El Nino in 1997/98, all of this adds up to a record CO2 rise this year,"" said lead author Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre and University of Exeter.Mauna Loa is famous because it is here that the rising trend in CO2 was first recorded by Charles David Keeling in 1958. At that time, CO2 levels were about 315 parts per million. This has been increasing at an average rate of 2.1 parts per million for the last 60 years.Using a seasonal climate forecast model and statistical relationship with sea temperatures, Professor Betts and colleagues forecast the rise this year to be a record 3.15 parts per million. The average concentration in 2016 is forecast to be 404.45 parts per million, dropping to 401.48 +- 0.53 in September before resuming their ongoing rise next year. The scientists already successfully predicted this year's maximum concentration of 407 parts per million last month.Carbon dioxide levels show modest ups-and-downs with the seasons. Plants draw down CO2 in the summer and release it again in the autumn and winter.""Carbon dioxide at Mauna Loa is currently above 400 parts per million, but would have been expected to drop back down below this level in September. However, we predict that this will not happen now, because the recent El Nino has warmed and dried tropical ecosystems and driven forest fires, adding to the CO2 rise,"" Betts said.Since natural processes only remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere gradually, levels will remain high even if human emissions began to decline. Scientists expect the concentrations to now remain above 400 parts per million for at least a human lifetime.Prof Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who is a co-author on the paper, said: ""Back in September last year, we suspected that we were measuring CO2 concentrations below 400 parts per million for the last time. Now it is looking like this was indeed the case."" The ongoing CO2 measurements at Mauna Loa used in this study are made by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and an independent set of measurements are made by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the Mauna Loa Observatory."

Ancient stars in the Milky Way were found to display minute 'pulses' in their brightness that was caused by sound trapped inside. Astrophysicists from the University of Birmingham captured these sounds, according to research published today in the Royal Astronomical Society journal Monthly Notices.The research team, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy, has reported the detection of resonant acoustic oscillations of stars in 'M4', one of the oldest known clusters of stars in the Galaxy, some 13 billion years old.Using data from the NASA Kepler/K2 mission, the team has studied the resonant oscillations of stars using a technique called asteroseismology. These oscillations lead to miniscule changes or pulses in brightness, and are caused by sound trapped inside the stars. By measuring the tones in this 'stellar music', it is possible to determine the mass and age of individual stars.This discovery opens the door to using asteroseismology to study the very early history of our Galaxy.Dr Andrea Miglio, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy, who led the study, said: ""We were thrilled to be able to listen to some of the stellar relics of the early universe. The stars we have studied really are living fossils from the time of the formation of our Galaxy, and we now hope be able to unlock the secrets of how spiral galaxies, like our own, formed and evolved.""Dr Guy Davies, from the University of Birmingham's School of Physics and Astronomy, and co-author on the study, said: ""The age scale of stars has so far been restricted to relatively young stars, limiting our ability to probe the early history of our Galaxy.

As the project director of 13 previous PSLV missions from C-15 to C-27, Kunhikrishnan said that the launch vehicle PSLV is highly reliable, versatile and has set an excellent track record, that it satisfies the customers from across the world. Hailing the efforts of ISRO in their successful PSLV-C34 mission, Chief Minister Pinnarayi Vijayan in his statement said it is a path-breaking venture in India's space mission. In space launch technology, it was possible for ISRO to win over major space faring nations including the US. Braving challenges of US sanctions, India has developed indigenous cryogenic technology, he said. Now, ISRO is on track to develop the advanced GSLV-Mark III and with its recent launch of IRNSS satellites, the country has also gained indigenous capability in global positioning system.

New IVF method limits transfer of bad DNA to babies: study,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/New-IVF-method-limits-transfer-of-bad-DNA-to-babies-study/articleshow/52661258.cms,"PARIS: Scientists on Wednesday unveiled an improved method of transferring DNA between human egg cells, a technique that aims to create embryos free of their mother's genetic defects.Refinements to an existing method known as ""pronuclear transfer"", sometimes called three-person IVF, greatly reduced the amount of faulty, disease-causing DNA in the lab-produced embryos, they reported in the journal Nature.The method involves extracting healthy DNA of the mother and father from the nucleus of a fertilised egg. Each egg cells also contains a different type of DNA residing in tiny cell structures called mitochondria.Sometimes the mitochondrial DNA undergo mutations which can be transmitted to offspring and can cause an array of disorders.The nuclear DNA is transferred into a donated egg cell -- with healthy mitochondrial DNA -- from which the nucleus has been removed.""(W)e are optimistic that the technique we have developed will offer affected women the possibility of reducing the risk of transmitting mitochondrial DNA disease to their children,"" said study co-author Mary Herbert of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research in England.Commentators said the study marked significant progress towards a safer form of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) for women who carry disease-causing mitochondrial mutations.Estimates vary widely, but about one in 5,000 children is thought to be born with these mutations which can affect the muscles, eye, brain or heart.There is no effective treatment.Mitochondria are tiny structures inside our cells which turn sugar and oxygen into energy. They are often referred to as the powerhouses or batteries of our cells.Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA within the cell nucleus.Sometimes, mutations in these genetic codes can cause the mitochondria to malfunction, resulting in organ failure and even death.Unlike nuclear DNA, which is transferred to offspring by the mother and father combined, mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother alone.Last year, Britain became the first country in the world to legalise pronuclear transfer for women with mitochondrial disorders.The new study, using over 500 eggs from 64 donor women, showed that small tweaks to the existing procedure can reduce the risk of mutant mitochondrial DNA transferral.It worked best to perform the procedure on the day of the egg's fertilisation, not later, the scientists found.And it was better to freeze the egg of the patient, rather than that of the donor.The embryos, which were not allowed to develop, contained less than two percent of the mutated mitochondrial DNA in the original egg, the authors found. This is below the five-percent threshold considered safe.The study was an important step, said commentators, but the two per cent level was still no guarantee against disease.According to Marni Falk of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's human genetics division, ""there is the chance that even small levels of mutant mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) can become unpredictably enriched in the developing person over time.""""Our ongoing research is focused on refining the techniques to further reduce the risk of transmitting disease,"" Herbert added.The results of the study will be presented to an expert panel of Britain's fertility treatment regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which must decide whether to issue the first licence to a clinic"

The biggest animals to survive on land would have been no larger than a cat, the study said.For the study, the researchers reviewed all mammal species known from the end of the Cretaceous period in North America.Their results showed that over 93 per cent of them became extinct across the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, but that they also recovered far more quickly than previously thought.The scientists analysed the published fossil record from western North America from two million years before the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, until 300,000 years after the asteroid hit.They compared species diversity before and after this extinction event to estimate the severity of the event and to gauge how quickly the mammals recovered.""The species that are most vulnerable to extinction are the rare ones, and because they are rare, their fossils are less likely to be found. The species that tend to survive are more common, so we tend to find them,"" said Nick Longrich, one of the researchers from Milner Centre for Evolution in University of Bath in England. ""The fossil record is biased in favour of the species that survived. As bad as things looked before, including more data shows the extinction was more severe than previously believed.""The researchers said this explains why the severity of the extinction event was previously underestimated.The study was published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology."

Astronomers spot black hole devouring cold gas cloud,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Astronomers-spot-black-hole-devouring-cold-gas-cloud/articleshow/52667922.cms,"LONDON: Marking the first direct evidence to support the theory that black holes feed on clouds of cold gas, astronomers have detected billowy clouds of cold, clumpy gas streaming towards a supermassive black hole at speeds of up to 800,000 miles per hour and feeding into its bottomless well.  Using one of the most powerful telescopes in the world -- the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA -- the team found that the feeding process was ""chaotic"" and ""clumpy"", as opposed to a smooth, simple and clean process that was previously hypothesised.  ""It was magical being able to see evidence of these clouds accreting onto the supermassive black hole,"" said one of the researchers Timothy Davis from School of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University in Britain.  ""At that very moment, nature gave us a clear view of this complicated process, allowing us to understand supermassive black holes in a way that has never been possible before,"" Davis noted.  The findings were detailed in the journal Nature.  ""The data has provided us with a snapshot of what is happening around the black hole at one precise time, so it's possible that the black hole has an ever bigger appetite and is devouring even more of these cold clouds of gas surrounding it,"" Davis said.  Previous models have suggested that the gradual growth of supermassive black holes -- a process known as accretion -- occurs when surrounding hot gas accumulates smoothly onto the black hole, much like a slow graze.  But the very first observations made by the international team of researchers suggest that in addition to this, supermassive black holes may occasionally quickly gobble up faster-moving cold gas as it comes nearby.  The research team used ALMA to observe a distant galaxy one billion light years away. The galaxy, called Abell 2597, spans some tens of thousands of light years across and is one of the brightest in the universe.  The team were interested in discerning how many stars were being born in the galaxy and therefore went about measuring cold gas - stars are formed when cold gas collapses.  To the team's surprise, they ended up discovering something quite unexpected at the centre of the galaxy around a supermassive black hole - the shadows of three very cold, clumpy gas clouds.  The three gas clouds were cast against bright jets of material spewing from the black hole, suggesting that these clouds were very close to being consumed by the black hole."

Diabetes gene: Experts to study Indian groups,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Diabetes-gene-Experts-to-study-Indian-groups/articleshow/52578915.cms,"CHENNAI: Say diabetes and the first things that come to mind are junk food, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. But rule out all three and you could still be susceptible to the ailment. The reason is in your genes.In an effort to nail these genes, a group of Indian and US scientists have set out to study 20 families from four communities - the Chettiar, Reddy, Aggarwal and Sikh Khatri - to find the genes that cause Type-2 diabetes.Experts say the findings could help prevent or delay onset of diabetes in susceptible people. The team will make a database which will help them compare type 2 diabetes profiles not just within the subject communities but with groups across the world.Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai, Annamalai University in Chidambaram, BM Birla Science and Technology Centre, Jaipur, and Narayana Medical College and Hospital, Nellore, are the collaborating institutes in India. US-based geneticist John Blangero, who will be interacting with the Indian institutes, said they would survey 1,500 people.""We chose India as it is easier to study genes in large families, spanning different generations,"" said Blangero, of the South Texas Diabetes and Obesity Institute at University of Texas. He said doctors still largely link diabetes to obesity in the US but, in India, things are more complex.""A majority of those with type-2 diabetes have a lower than normal BMI, hinting at the role of genes as a contributing factor,"" he said. Blangero has also been studying the genes of 85 families in Mexico for the 25 years. He estimated genetic variation was the reason for at least 60% of those with type-2 diabetes. ""In most cases it is a combination of both - genetic and environmental factors,"" Blangero said.There are more than 65.1 million people with diabetes in India, with type-2 accounting for about 90% of all cases. In type-2, cells in the body don't respond to insulin, the hormone that helps convert glucose from food into energy. This results in glucose build-up in the bloodstream.Dr Solomon Paul, head of the department of human genetics at SRMU, said, ""We hope to open a window to studying this pandemic and come up with targeted drugs for its treatment,"" he said."

In fact, not just obesity, it makes the 30-35 age group the most vulnerable section susceptible for a dozen odd lifestyle diseases linked to higher BMI like osteoarthritis, diabetes, hypertension, fatty liver, obstructive sleep apnea, coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, menstrual disorder, deep vein thrombosis and several others. ""The best way to avoid all these complications is to maintain a healthy BMI score i.e when it is between 18.5 to 24.9. Anything more or less than this score is sure to land one into problem,"" said Megha More, co-founder & COO, Trueweight. Defined as a measurement of person's overall body shape based on weight and height, a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight, a score between 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and if it is higher than 30, then one is categorised as obese. The two other age brackets found with BMI score higher than 30 in the study were those aged between 36-40 years (14%) and above 40 plus category (13%). Incidentally, in these two age groups too, women outnumbered men with 66.60% and 73.46% diagnosed as obese for the two age groups respectively. ""These age groups with higher BMI than 30 can land up with several medical complications but cartilage damage in knee leading to osteoarthritis is the most common risk that 50-60% of obese people are likely to develop,"" said Dr Praveen Mereddy, consultant joint replacement & arthoscopy surgeon, Care Hospital, Banjara Hills. He warned that even a five kilogram excess weight than what is normal for a person with a healthy BMI score for his weight and height, has potential to cause him or her knee pain. But the million dollar question is why is 30-35 age group more prone to develop a BMI score higher than 30, landing them into obesity? ""These group of people are in their productive life and to make a good living and earning, not just work more but even during irregular hours. Eating junk food when available, irregular food habits and often skip breakfast and meals,"" said Dr Tapas Mishra, Laproscopic, Bariatric and metabolic surgeon, Apollo Hospital, Hyderguda. While advising bariatric surgery for those with BMI higher than 35, Dr Tapas adds that those in 30-35 age aggravate their problem with inadequate sleep pattern, not finding enough time to exercise regularly and having endless cups of tea and coffee or party outside, adding more calories than what the body requires. So, what's the remedy?""More than physical activity, go for a healthy eating plan that is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. For this, one must read labels on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup,"" Dr Zeenath Fatima, dietician, Continental Hospitals, while advising people to limit alcohol intake as well as it too adds calories.However, Suhasini Mudraganam, head nutritionist, Truweight, stresses on the important role that customised meal plans can play to solve the problem of unhealthy lifestyle.""A customised meal plan is prepared after evaluating a person's health so that they lose weight,"" she said."

Since the Brazil outbreak, Zika virus has been detected in an additional 39 countries, including in Europe, the UK, South America and Asia.Many researchers are working to anticipate the virus's potential spread, especially given that it can be carried by lightly infected travellers and then passed onto others by mosquitoes.Global concern and attention are elevated with thousands of visitors set to attend the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this summer.Nishiura and colleagues predicted the virus' potential of importation and local transmission by the end of this year using a survival analysis model, information about airline transportation networks, and transmission data for dengue and chikungunya viruses, which are also transmitted by the same mosquito species.They collected Zika data up to January 31 this year and they note that new cases were confirmed in more countries shortly thereafter.The study was published in the journal Peer J."

Radio map unveils ammonia gas in Jupiter's atmosphere,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Radio-map-unveils-ammonia-gas-in-Jupiters-atmosphere/articleshow/52569639.cms,"WASHINGTON: Astronomers have produced the most detailed radio map yet of the atmosphere of Jupiter, unveiling massive movement of ammonia gas under the colourful bands, spots and whirling clouds visible to the naked eye.The University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) researchers used the upgraded Karl G Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico to measure radio emissions from Jupiter's atmosphere in wavelength bands where clouds are transparent.They were able to see as deep as 100 kilometres below the cloud tops, a largely unexplored region where clouds form.The planet's thermal radio emissions are partially absorbed by ammonia gas. Based on the amount of absorption, the researchers could determine how much ammonia is present and at what depth.By studying these regions of the planet's atmosphere, astronomers hope to learn how global circulation and cloud formation are driven by Jupiter's powerful internal heat source.These studies also will shed light on similar processes occurring on other giant planets in our solar system and on newly discovered giant exoplanets around distant stars.""We in essence created a three-dimensional picture of ammonia gas in Jupiter's atmosphere, which reveals upward and downward motions within the turbulent atmosphere,"" said Imke de Pater, a professor at UC Berkeley.The radio map shows ammonia-rich gases rising into and forming the upper cloud layers: an ammonium hydrosulfide cloud at a temperature near minus 73 degrees Celsius and an ammonia-ice cloud in about minus 113 degrees Celsius. These clouds are easily seen from Earth by optical telescopes.Conversely, the radio maps show ammonia-poor air sinking into the planet, similar to how dry air descends from above the cloud layers on Earth.The map also shows that hotspots - so-called because they appear bright in radio and thermal infrared images - are ammonia-poor regions that encircle the planet like a belt just north of the equator.Between these hotspots are ammonia-rich upwellings that bring ammonia from deeper in the planet.""With radio, we can peer through the clouds and see that those hotspots are interleaved with plumes of ammonia rising from deep in the planet, tracing the vertical undulations of an equatorial wave system,"" said Michael Wong of UC Berkeley.The final maps have the best spatial resolution ever achieved in a radio map: 1,300 kilometres, researchers said.""We now see high ammonia levels like those detected by Galileo from over 100 kilometres deep, where the pressure is about eight times Earth's atmospheric pressure, all the way up to the cloud condensation levels,"" de Pater said.The observations are being reported just a month before the July 4 arrival at Jupiter of NASA's Juno spacecraft, which plans, in part, to measure the amount of water in the deep atmosphere where the Very Large Array looked for ammonia.The study was published in the journal Science."

Teenage smokers at greater risk of developing lung cancer or heart disease,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Teenage-smokers-at-greater-risk-of-developing-lung-cancer-or-heart-disease/articleshow/52527116.cms,"MUMBAI: Younger the age at which people start smoking, greater the certainty that they will end up with one of several life threatening diseases. Early smoking is associated with subsequent heavier smoking, higher levels of dependency, a lower chance of quitting, and an overall higher rate of mortality. ""Cigarette smoking during adolescence and young adulthood begins the damaging processes that lead to cardiovascular disease. Damage to the circulatory system becomes evident in young smokers, and may become clinically significant in early adulthood,"" said Dr Praveen Kulkarni, cardiologist, Global Hospital. Many teenagers and adults believe in the myth that smoking will not affect them till middle age. Smoking has numerous immediate health effects on the brain and on the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune and metabolic system. While these immediate effects do not all produce noticeable symptoms, most begin to damage the body with the first cigarette itself. Children are also more susceptible to the effects of passive smoking. Bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and sudden infant death syndrome (cot death) are significantly more common in infants and children who have one or two smoking parents. ""There are many cases where children pick up smoking under the influence of smoker parents. Habit of smoking is also picked up by adolescent and teenage girls, which if continued, can lead to problems like - infertility, intrauterine fetal deaths, premature deliveries,"" said pulmonologist Dr Samir Garde."

"Extreme weather increasing level of toxins in food, scientists warn",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Extreme-weather-increasing-level-of-toxins-in-food-scientists-warn/articleshow/52515100.cms,"NAIROBI: As they struggle to deal with more extreme weather, a range of food crops are generating more of chemical compounds that can cause health problems for people and livestock who eat them, scientists have warned.A new report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that crops such as wheat and maize are generating more potential toxins as a reaction to protect themselves from extreme weather.But these chemical compounds are harmful to people and animals if consumed for a prolonged period of time, according to a report released during a United Nations Environment Assembly meeting in Nairobi.""Crops are responding to drought conditions and increases in temperature just like humans do when faced with a stressful situation,"" explained Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist and director of the Division of Early Warning and Assessment at UNEP.Under normal conditions, for instance, plants convert nitrates they absorb into nutritious amino acids and proteins. But prolonged drought slows or prevents this conversion, leading to more potentially problematic nitrate accumulating in the plant, the report said.If people eat too much nitrate in their diets, it can interfere with the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen in the body, the report said.Crops susceptible to accumulating too much nitrate in times of stress include maize, wheat, barley, soybeans, millet and sorghum, it said.DROUGHT, THEN RAINSome drought-stressed crops, when then exposed to sudden large amounts of rain that lead to rapid growth, in turn accumulate hydrogen cyanide, more commonly known as prussic acid, the report said.Prussic acid - one of the ingredients used in some types of chemical warfare - interferes with oxygen flow in humans. Even short-term exposure can be debilitating for people, McGlade said.Plants such as cassava, flax, maize and sorghum are most vulnerable to dangerous prussic acid accumulation, the report said.Cases of nitrate or hydrogen cyanide poisoning in humans were reported in Kenya in 2013 and in the Philippines in 2005, McGlade said. In Kenya, two children died in coastal Kilifi after eating cassava that had raised levels of prussic acid in it following extreme rainfall, according to local media reports.Aflatoxins, molds that can affect plant crops and raise the risk of liver damage, cancer and blindness, as well as stunting foetuses and infants, also are spreading to more areas as a result of shifting weather patterns, scientists said.McGlade said about 4.5 billion people in developing countries are exposed to aflatoxins each year, though the amounts are largely unmonitored, and the numbers are rising.""We are just beginning to recognise the magnitude of toxin-related issues confronting farmers in developing countries of the tropics and sub-tropics,"" the report noted.""As warmer climate zones expand towards the poles, countries in more temperate regions are facing new threats,"" it added.In 2004, Kenya suffered severe outbreaks of aflatoxin poisoning, which affected more than 300 people and killed more than 100 following a prolonged drought, according to the International Livestock Research Institute.EUROPE AT RISKThe UNEP report said Europe will be at growing risk from aflatoxins in locally grown crops if global temperatures rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius. The world is currently on a path to a more than 3 degree Celsius temperature rise, scientists believe.An increase in toxic compounds in crops is likely to impact heavily on the world's health system, which are already struggling with the effects of food insecurity, Dorota Jarosinska of the World Health Organization's European Center for Environment and Health said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Alex Ezeh, executive director of the African Population Health and Research Center, said the increase in toxins in crops was a big concern.""Toxic crops can lead to neurological diseases among humans but the greatest challenge is the incidence of cancer,"" he said in an interview.The report proposes a list of eight ideas farmers and agricultural experts can adopt to try to limit damage from more crop toxins, such as mapping contamination hotspots and building better evidence about what is happening now with the toxins in their area.Scientists also suggest that developing crop varieties designed to cope with extreme weather could help reduce the levels of toxic chemicals in food.""Research centers with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research are developing seeds that are suitable in various regions that have been hit by climate change,"" McGlade said."

Rare 'baby dragon' hatches in Slovenia,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Rare-baby-dragon-hatches-in-Slovenia/articleshow/52538567.cms,"POSTOJNA: The strange, slithery creatures inside Slovenia's Postojna cave were once considered living proof that dragons existed, prompting locals to give it a wide berth.Now, large crowds from all over the world have been queuing up to witness the extremely rare hatching of the mysterious olms -- ancient underwater predators that can live up to 100 years and only breed once in a decade.Their treat came Tuesday when the translucent larva broke through the delicate egg envelope after four months of nervously monitored gestation.The birth, caught on live camera, is nothing short of ""a miracle,"" cave spokesmen said.""A mere two baby olms successfully hatch from 500 eggs in nature,"" they said in a jubilant statement.Found primarily in Balkan cave rivers, the protected eel-like species has been living in the world-famous Postojna cave, 50 kilometres (30 miles) southwest of the capital Ljubljana, for what researchers say is millions of years.This week, the tourist attraction became one of the first ever human-controlled environments to successfully breed a baby olm.""Although both science and researchers' previous experience gave us almost zero chance that the drama unfolding in the cave aquarium before our very eyes would have a happy ending... we had faith it would happen,"" the cave statement said.The good news doesn't end there: the new arrival could soon be joined by several siblings, with more eggs set to hatch at any moment.Inside a giant hall, the mother and her precious spawn are kept in complete darkness in a covered tank under the continuous watch of a night-vision camera.On a nearby television screen, visitors can see the miniature eggs spread over a rock. From time to time, one of the embryos stirs ever so lightly.""It's one of those moments where you are happy to be alive now and experience such a unique event,"" said Saso Weldt, a biologist working at Postojna, one of Europe's largest caves that draws 700,000 visitors a year.Weldt and his team hope the new arrivals will help to shed fresh light on the enigmatic olm, which has become a national symbol and even featured on Slovenia's currency before the euro was introduced.While locals now fondly talk of their ""baby dragons"", people for centuries were too afraid to even go near the cave.During winter, heavy rains would wash out the wriggly creatures from the grotto as it lay surrounded by a sea of thick fog, according to 17th century folk tales.Slovenians believed them to be the offspring of fire-breathing ""dragons living inside the dangerous cave"", explained Weldt.Reaching a maximum length of 35 centimeters the blind animal with its four tiny limbs is a far cry from the scary monsters conjured up in national folklore.Sometimes also referred to as ""human fish,"" the slim vertebrate sports have pink three feathery gills on each side of their elongated snout. The body's sheer pink skin makes it easy to spot the internal organs.But its cave-dwelling existence has also equipped the olm with some extremely powerful skills.In place of sight, it has developed acute sensory receptors for smell and movement, helping it to hunt for prey like crabs and snails in the dark, or snap at intruders.Even more impressively, the small predator can go without food for up to a decade.Breeding olms is a difficult and often fatal affair. A previous try in 2013 failed to produce any fertilized eggs at Postojna.But the latest attempt looks more promising.Of the 64 eggs laid in January, two dozen remained alive, with their gills functional and their hearts clearly beating.For those who make it, the path to adulthood will be long: ""They will take around 10 to 15 years to reach their full size,"" noted Weldt.And even then, their long-term survival is not guaranteed.Although not officially endangered, the species is nevertheless considered vulnerable as it finds itself at risk of environmental changes like pollution seeping into the so-called karsts, or caves created from water eating through soluble rocks like limestone.""Olms are a flagship species need of protection. If there's too much pollution, they will disappear,"" warned Weldt."

However, numbers of such cases are on decline since then, officials in the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) as well as in the health ministry claimed.This comes in the wake of data sought through RTI from NACO showing 2234 persons across India were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting blood transfusions in 17 months (from October 2014 to March 2016).The officials also said the data is ""not scientific"" and is instead based on subjective responses received from people visiting for HIV testing.""There are several occasions when patients do not declare the exact reason or means of transmission because of societal pressure or even lack of awareness and sometimes ignorance. Therefore, the data cannot be considered 100% accurate,"" a senior official at NACO said.However, the government maintained it is also working towards stringent blood safety screening and to introduce technologies to ensure zero transmission.In India, NACO has been primarily responsible for ensuring transfer of safe blood.According to the 2015 annual report, till September 2014, NACO's total blood collection was around 30 lakh units. The total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated at around 20.9 lakh in 2011. Nearly 86% of these patients are in the 15-49 age-group.

Universe expanding faster than expected: Nasa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Universe-expanding-faster-than-expected-Nasa/articleshow/52567643.cms,"WASHINGTON: The universe is expanding 5 to 9 per cent faster than thought, astronomers using Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope have discovered.""This surprising finding may be an important clue to understanding those mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 per cent of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation,"" said study leader and Nobel Laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute and The Johns Hopkins University in the US.Researchers made the discovery by refining the universe's current expansion rate to unprecedented accuracy, reducing the uncertainty to only 2.4 per cent.The team made the refinements by developing innovative techniques that improved the precision of distance measurements to faraway galaxies.They looked for galaxies containing both Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae. Cepheid stars pulsate at rates that correspond to their true brightness, which can be compared with their apparent brightness as seen from Earth to accurately determine their distance.Type Ia supernovae, another commonly used cosmic yardstick, are exploding stars that flare with the same brightness and are brilliant enough to be seen from relatively longer distances.By measuring about 2,400 Cepheid stars in 19 galaxies and comparing the observed brightness of both types of stars, researchers accurately calculated distances to roughly 300 Type Ia supernovae in far-flung galaxies.They compared those distances with the expansion of space as measured by the stretching of light from receding galaxies.The team used these two values to calculate how fast the universe expands with time, or the Hubble constant.The improved Hubble constant value is 73.2 kilometres per second per megaparsec. A megaparsec equals 3.26 million light-years.The new value means the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.This refined calibration presents a puzzle, however, because it does not quite match the expansion rate predicted for the universe from its trajectory seen shortly after the Big Bang.Measurements of the afterglow from the Big Bang by Nasa's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the European Space Agency's Planck satellite mission yield predictions for the Hubble constant that are 5 per cent and 9 per cent smaller.""If we know the initial amounts of stuff in the universe, such as dark energy and dark matter, and we have the physics correct, then you can go from a measurement at the time shortly after the big bang and use that understanding to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today,"" said Riess.""However, if this discrepancy holds up, it appears we may not have the right understanding, and it changes how big the Hubble constant should be today,"" he said.The research appears in The Astrophysical Journal."

Hydrogen signal from remote galaxy 'detected',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Hydrogen-signal-from-remote-galaxy-detected/articleshow/52550013.cms,"NEW DELHI: Using the Very Large Array (VLA), located in New Mexico, US, an international team of scientists has detected a faint signal emitted by hydrogen gas in a galaxy more than five billion light years away. This incredible measurement is almost double the previous record of distance.""These signals would have begun their journey before our planet even existed, and after five billion years of travelling through space without hitting anything, they've fallen into the telescope, and allowed us to see this distant galaxy for the very first time,"" said lead author, Ximena Fernandez from Rutgers University in US.The team found that the distant galaxy would have contained billions of young, massive stars surrounded by clouds of hydrogen gas.As the most abundant element in the universe, and the raw fuel for creating stars, hydrogen is used by radio astronomers to detect and understand the makeup of other galaxies.However, until now, radio telescopes have only been able to detect the emission signature of hydrogen from relatively near galaxies.""Due to the upgrade of the VLA, this is the first time we've been able to directly measure atomic hydrogen in a galaxy this far from Earth,"" Fernandez said.This success for the team comes after the first 178 hours of observing time with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Arra radio telescope for a new survey of the sky called the 'COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey', or CHILES for short. Once it's completed, the CHILES survey will have collected data from more than 1,000 hours of observing time.""A question we hope to answer is whether galaxies in the past had more gas being turned into stars than galaxies today. Our record breaking find is a galaxy with an unusually large amount of hydrogen,"" she said.In a new approach, members of the team including Dr Attila Popping from International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research and the ARC Centre of All-sky Astrophysics (CAASTRO) in Australia are working with Amazon Web Services to process and move the large volumes of data via the 'cloud'.""For this project, we took tens of terabytes of data from the VLA, and then processed it using Amazon's cloud-based servers to create an enormous image cube, ready for our team to analyse and explore,"" Dr Popping said.Professor Andreas Wicenec, head of the Data Intensive Astronomy team at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said that the limiting factor for radio astronomers used to be the size of the telescope and the hardware behind it. ""It is fast becoming more about the data and how you move, store and analyse vast volumes of information,"" he claimed. ""Big science needs a lot of compute power - right now we're designing systems to manage data for several large facilities around the world and the next generation of radio telescopes, including China's 500m radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array and the SKA's pathfinder telescopes that are already up and running in outback Western Australia.""

Scientists devise a new method to deal with jet lag,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Scientists-devise-a-new-method-to-deal-with-jet-lag/articleshow/52503143.cms,"TOKYO: Frequent travellers have a reason to rejoice. Scientists have designed new molecules which can modify the sleep and wake cycle, paving the way for improved treatments for jet lag and sleep disorders. The negative impacts of jet lag and shift work could be significantly reduced if it were possible to reset our 24-hour natural circadian or sleep and wake cycle, researchers said.Now, scientists from Nagoya University's Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules (ITbM) in Japan have synthesized molecules that can shorten the circadian period.These molecules act directly on one of our ""clock proteins"", called CRY, researchers said.Most living organisms, including humans, have a biological clock that resets every 24 hours, regulating functions such as sleep and wake cycles and metabolism. When this cycle is disrupted, like in jet lag, sleep disorders occur, they said.Long-term sleep loss may affect the cardiovascular, endocrine, immune and nervous systems with severe consequences including hypertension, obesity and mental health disorders, among others.Our biological clock is basically run by four ""master regulator"" proteins that work in tandem. CLOCK and BMAL1, when combined, promote the production of the proteins PER and CRY.These proteins, in turn, block CLOCK and BMAL1, thus, closing the cycle.This cycle of activation, production and stop or block goes around once a day and is also influenced by a compound called FBXL3, which flags CRY for degradation by cellular enzymes, researchers said.A molecule discovered in 2012, called KL001, lengthens the circadian cycle by competing with FBLX3 for the same spot on the CRY protein, preventing its degradation.By analyzing its structure, researchers prepared compounds that were similar to KL001, thus synthesizing the first circadian shortening molecules that target the CRY protein.""We hope we can make further use of synthetic chemistry to make bioactive molecules that can control the circadian rhythm of animals and gain further insight into the circadian clock mechanism, which will surely contribute to medical applications, food production and advances in clock research,"" said Takashi Yoshimura from ITbM."
